'''The Hampshire Hog''' was a tavern at 410 The Strand, London, next door to The [[Adelphi Theatre]].

Its trade relied heavily on visitors to the theatre.

The pub was taken over in 1887 (along with the house next door and the [[Nell Gwynne]] tavern in Bull Inn Court) by the Adelphi Theatre (at the time run by the Gatti family.) The Hampshire Hog was renovated and absorbed into the theatre complex.

A new enlarged facade was built as part of the renovation, and this can still be seen today.
