'''Oracle Grid Engine''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/software/sge/|title=Oracle Grid Engine|date=2010-05-303|publisher=Oracle Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; previously known as ''Sun Grid Engine'' ('''SGE'''), '''CODINE''' (Computing in Distributed Networked Environments) or '''GRD''' (Global Resource Director),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sun.com/templedf/entry/a_little_history_lesson|title=A Little History Lesson|date=2006-06-23|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[open source]] [[batch-queuing system]], developed and supported by [[Sun Microsystems]].  Sun once also sold a commercial product based on SGE, known as '''N1 Grid Engine''' ('''N1GE''').

Grid Engine is open source and free to use from the project website under the [[Sun Industry Standards Source License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gridengine.sunsource.net/license.html|title=The Grid Engine Source License|date=2010-06-04|publisher=Sun MicroSystems}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a commercial version available from the Oracle site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/products/tools/oracle-grid-engine-075549.html|title=Oracle Grid Engine|date=2010-07-26|publisher=Oracle Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that all further versions, starting from 6.2u6, will be commercial (with a 90-day free trial).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gridengine.sunsource.net/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=38&amp;dsMessageId=264919&amp;orderBy=createDate&amp;orderType=desc|title=A discussion at GridEngine forums|date=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SGE is typically used on a computer farm or [[high-performance computing]] (HPC) [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]] and is responsible for accepting, scheduling, dispatching, and managing the remote and distributed execution of large numbers of standalone, parallel or interactive user jobs.  It also manages and schedules the allocation of distributed resources such as processors, memory, disk space, and [[software license]]s.

SGE is the foundation of the [[Sun Grid]] [[utility computing]] system, made available over the [[Internet]] in the [[United States]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2006-03/sunflash.20060322.1.xml|title=World's First Utility Grid Comes Alive on the Internet|date=2006-03-22|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}&lt;/ref&gt; later becoming available in many other countries.

==Platforms==
SGE runs on multiple platforms, including:
* [[AIX operating system|AIX]]
* [[BSD]] - [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]]
* [[HP-UX]]
* [[IRIX]]
* [[Linux]]
* [[Mac OS X]]
* [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]

* [[Tru64]]
* [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] via SFU ([[Interix]]) or SUA ([[Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX]]) (as execution hosts only)
* [[Z/OS]] (in progress{{When|date=October 2011}})

==Cluster architecture==
A typical Grid Engine cluster consists of a master host and one or more execution hosts. Multiple ''shadow masters'' can also be configured as [[hot spare]]s, which take over the role of the master when the original master host crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= How to Install the Shadow Master Host  |url= http://wikis.sun.com/display/gridengine62u3/How+to+Install+the+Shadow+Master+Host |work= Sun Grid Engine 6.2u3  blog |date= August 27, 2009 |accessdate= October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and training==
Sun provided support contracts 
for the commercial version of Grid Engine on most [[UNIX]] platforms and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.sun.com/CMTemplate/CEServlet?process=SunStore&amp;cmdViewProduct_CP&amp;catid=115672 | title = Sun Store Grid Engine Entitlement Purchase | accessdate = 2008-03-03 | publisher = Sun Microsystems |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071030012101/http://store.sun.com/CMTemplate/CEServlet?process=SunStore&amp;cmdViewProduct_CP&amp;catid=115672 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional services, consulting, training, and support were provided by Sun Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sun.com/software/gridware/partners/index.xml | title = Sun Grid Engine 6 Partners | accessdate = 2007-12-14 | publisher = Sun Microsystems }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun partners with [[Georgetown University]] to deliver Grid Engine administration classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.sun.com/templedf/entry/advanced_sun_grid_engine_configuration | title = Advanced Sun Grid Engine Configuration and Administration Class | accessdate = 2007-12-14 | publisher = Sun Microsystems }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bioteam'' runs short SGE training workshops that are 1 or 2 days long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.bioteam.net/category/training/ | title = Training | accessdate = 2008-03-24 | publisher = The Bioteam Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users obtained community support on the Grid Engine mailing lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gridengine.sunsource.net/maillist.html |deadurl= yes |title = Grid Engine Mail Lists |publisher = Sun Microsystems |archivedate= December 25, 2008 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081225034600/http://gridengine.sunsource.net/maillist.html |accessdate= October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Sun Microsystems]] --&gt;
In 2000, Sun acquired Gridware, Inc. a privately owned commercial vendor of advanced computing resource management software with offices in San Jose, Calif., and Regensburg, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2000-07/sunflash.20000724.3.xml|title=Gridware's resource management software increases efficiency and productivity in compute-intensive technical computing environments|date=2000-07-24|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, Sun offered a free version of Gridware for Solaris and Linux, and renamed the product Sun Grid Engine.

In 2001, Sun made the [[source code]] available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2001-07/sunflash.20010723.1.xml|title=Sun Microsystems makes SUN GRID ENGINE software available to open source community|date=2001-07-23|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted the open source development model. Ports for Mac OS X and *BSD were contributed by the non-Sun open source developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsdcan.org/2010/schedule/events/169.en.html|title=Porting HPC Tools to FreeBSD|date=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, after the purchase of Sun by Oracle, the Grid Engine 6.2 update 6 source code was not included with the binaries, and changes were not put back to the project's source repository. In response to this, the Grid Engine community started the [[Open Grid Scheduler]] project to continue to develop and maintain a free implementation of Grid Engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/gridscheduler/ Open Grid Scheduler]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7850|title=The State of Oracle/Sun Grid Engine|first=Douglas|last=Eadline, Ph.D.|date=September 1, 2010|accessdate=2011-01-18|publisher=Linux Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markmail.org/message/hcxond5s4cywe5dv|title=Changes for a Bright Future at Oracle|first=Daniel|last=Templeton|date=2010-12-23|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2011, it was announced that [[Univa]] had recruited several principal engineers from the former Sun Grid Engine team and that Univa would be developing their own [[Fork (software development)|forked]] version of Grid Engine.  The newly announced [[Univa Grid Engine]] will include commercial support and would compete with the official version of Oracle Grid Engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://www.univa.com/about/news/press_2011/01172011.php|title=Univa Acquires Grid Engine Expertise|date=2011-01-18|publisher=Univa|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcwire.com/features/Univa-Rescues-Grid-Engine-From-Oracle-114140804.html|title=Univa Rescues Grid Engine From Oracle|publisher=HPCwire|first=Michael|last=Feldman|date=2011-01-18|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/18/univa_forks_oracle_grid_engine/|title=Univa forks Oracle's Sun Grid Engine|first=Timothy Prickett|last=Morgan|publisher=The Register|date=2011-01-18|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
