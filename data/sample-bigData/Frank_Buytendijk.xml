      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Frank Buytendijk''' ([[The Hague]], 1969) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] author of management books. He studied business and information technology at the [[Hogeschool Utrecht]] (University of Applied Sciences Utrecht), was a consultant at various firms in his home country, a research analyst and held executive positions in various large, medium and small software companies. He has a background in [[business intelligence]], [[corporate performance management]] and [[business process management]]. Buytendijk is also a visiting fellow at [[Cranfield University]] School of Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.som.cranfield.ac.uk/som/p14021/People/Faculty/Visiting-Fellows/Frank-Buytendijk Visiting Fellow Biography on Cranfield University website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he was appointed fellow at The Data Warehousing Institute (TDWI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdwi.eu/tdwi-germany-ev/tdwi-fellow Fellow at TDWI]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Frank is a Research vice president at analyst firm [[Gartner]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/AnalystBiography?authorId=17247 Gartner analyst profile]&lt;/ref&gt; where he served before as well, between 2001 and 2006. 

He wrote five books,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&amp;q=frank+buytendijk Worldcat author record]&lt;/ref&gt; related to [[strategy]], [[organizational behavior]] and [[performance management]]. A common theme throughout these books is the application of [[stakeholder theory]] in business. 

According to [http://www.managementboek.nl/boek/9789014065748/balanced-scorecard-frank-buytendijk managementboek.nl], his first book, on [[balanced scorecard]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Balanced Scorecard: Van Meten Naar Managen (Dutch), Buytendijk, F.A. &amp; Brinkhuis-Slaghuis, J., 2000, Kluwer, ISBN 9014065744&lt;/ref&gt; briefly reached the #1 sales position for management books in the Netherlands, and remained in the top 100 for 890 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.managementboek.nl/boek/9789014065748/balanced-scorecard-frank-buytendijk #1 sales position on managementboek.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; The second book, on data warehouses, quickly followed.&lt;ref&gt;Datawarehouses: Bron van Kennis voor Marketing en Sales (Dutch), Buytendijk, F.A. &amp; Groot, C. de, 2000, Kluwer, ISBN 9014068204&lt;/ref&gt; This was a more technology-oriented book. Both the first and second book were in Dutch.

Buytendijk's third book, "Performance Leadership" was published by [[McGraw-Hill]] and discussed the relationship between performance management and organizational behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Performance Leadership, Buytendijk, F.A., 2008, McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0071599649&lt;/ref&gt; The book has its roots in [[behavioral economics]]. "Dealing with Dilemmas", published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] followed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Dealing with Dilemmas, Buytendijk, F.A., 2010, Wiley &amp; Sons, ISBN 0470630310&lt;/ref&gt; It argues, following [[Henry Mintzberg]], that strategy is full of [[dilemma]]s that require a different approach than traditional [[analysis]], namely the opposite, [[synthesis]]. Part of the book, on [[scenario planning]] and [[strategy maps]], is also available as a case study in the [[Harvard Business Review]] database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/product/scenario-based-strategy-maps/an/BH391-PDF-ENG Harvard Business Review case study]&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth book, called "Socrates Reloaded" consists of a number of essays diving deeper into philosophical aspects of business and technology that started to emerge in "Dealing with Dilemmas".&lt;ref&gt;Socrates Reloaded, Buytendijk, F.A., 2012, Beingfrank, ISBN 1478316349&lt;/ref&gt;
