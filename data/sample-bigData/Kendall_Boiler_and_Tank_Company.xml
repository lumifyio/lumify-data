'''Kendall Boiler and Tank Company Building''' is a one story commercial edifice located on 275 Third Street in [[Kendall Square]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The brick building was formerly owned by the Kendall Boiler and Tank Company and is part of the [[Blake and Knowles Steam Pump Company National Register District]], on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worthingtonapt.com/history2.htm History2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880 Mr. Edward Kendall founded the company to manufacture steam boilers. Kendall Boiler and Tank Company relocated to its present home in Chelmsford, MA in the 20th century. &lt;ref&gt;[http://kendallboiler.com/our-history/ Kendall Boiler and Tank Co., Inc.
