'''Mýtna''' is a [[village]] and [[municipality]] in the [[Lučenec District]] in the [[Banská Bystrica Region]] of [[Slovakia]].

Mýtna was already settled in the prehistorical era - some scientists supposed that people already lived here in the younger [[Bronze Age]] probably 3,000 years ago. In the 7th century came [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] and then [[Slav]]s. The first mention of that village comes from 14th century (1393) called 'Wamuslehutaya' it means toll (duty) village. In 1467 'Wamosfalva' and in 1773 had nearly the present name but with i 'Mitna'. That name likely comes from 1423 when there was just several houses, and the toll house which served to pay a toll (duty) because of using the way from [[Zvolen]] to [[Lučenec]]. 2km away lies the Castle of Divin which took the toll. In 1467 Mýtna already belonged under the Castle. Gradual settlement in the Valley of [[Kriváň]] creek came from the north and northwest and was completed settlement in the surrounding mountains in the 19th and 20th century. The village at present introduces an entrance gateway for traveling in the northwest region of [[Novohrad]]. It already has all offer of shops and services not only for own residents but also for a visitors.
