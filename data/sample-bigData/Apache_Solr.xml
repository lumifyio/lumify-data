'''Solr''' (pronounced "solar") is an [[open source]] enterprise search platform from the '''Apache [[Lucene]]''' project. Its major features include full-text search, hit highlighting, [[faceted search]], dynamic clustering, database integration, and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. Providing distributed search and index replication, Solr is highly scalable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lucene.apache.org/solr/#intro What is Solr?]&lt;/ref&gt; Solr is the most popular enterprise search engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://db-engines.com/en/ranking/search+engine DB-Engines Ranking of Search Engines]&lt;/ref&gt; Solr 4 adds [[NoSQL]] features.&lt;ref&gt;http://searchhub.org/2012/05/21/solr-4-preview/&lt;/ref&gt;

Solr is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and runs as a standalone full-text search server within a [[servlet]] container such as [[Apache Tomcat]] or [[Jetty (web server)|Jetty]]. Solr uses the [[Lucene]] Java search library at its core for full-text indexing and search, and has [[REST]]-like [[HTTP]]/[[XML]] and [[JSON]] APIs that make it usable from most popular programming languages. Solr's powerful external configuration allows it to be tailored to many types of application without Java coding, and it has a plugin architecture to support more advanced customization.

Apache [[Lucene]] and Apache Solr are both produced by the same Apache Software Foundation development team since the two projects were merged in 2010.  It is common to refer to the technology or products as Lucene/Solr or Solr/Lucene.

== History ==
In 2004, Solr was created by Yonik Seeley at [[CNET Networks]] as an in-house project to add search capability for the company website. Yonik Seeley along with Grant Ingersoll and Erik Hatcher went on to launch [[LucidWorks]] (was Lucid Imagination), a company providing commercial support, consulting and training for Apache Solr search technologies.

In January 2006, CNET Networks decided to openly publish the source code by donating it to the [[Apache Software Foundation]] under the Lucene top-level project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-1 Source code that CNET is granting to the ASF for the Solr project]&lt;/ref&gt; Like any new project at [[Apache Software Foundation]] it entered an incubation period which helped solve organizational, legal, and financial issues.

In January 2007, Solr graduated from incubation status and grew steadily with accumulated features thereby attracting a robust community of users, contributors, and committers. Although quite new as a public project, it is already used for several high-traffic websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.apache.org/solr/PublicServers Public Websites that use Solr]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Solr 1.3 was released with many enhancements including distributed search capabilities and performance enhancements among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lucene.apache.org/solr/#15+September+2008+-+Solr+1.3.0+Available Solr 1.3 Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

November 2009 saw the release of Solr 1.4 This version introduces enhancements in indexing, searching and faceting along with many other improvements such as Rich Document processing ([[PDF]], [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[HTML]]), Search Results clustering based on [[Carrot2]] and also improved database integration. The release also features many additional plug-ins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lucene.apache.org/solr/#10+November+2009+-+Solr+1.4+Released Solr 1.4 Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the [[Lucene]] and Solr projects merged.  Separate downloads will continue, but the products are now jointly developed by a single set of committers.

In 2011, the Solr version number scheme was changed in order to match that of Lucene. After Solr 1.4, the next release of Solr was labeled 3.1, in order to keep Solr and Lucene on the same version number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.apache.org/solr/Solr3.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 Solr version 4.0 was released, including the new SolrCloud feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lucene.apache.org/solr/solrnews.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

2013 has seen a number of Solr releases already, including 4.1 in January, 4.2 in March, 4.2.1 in April and 4.3.0 in May, including many improvements in the SolrCloud features such as custom sharding.

== Community and future ==
Solr has an active development community, both individuals and companies, who contribute new features and bug fixes.

== Integrating Solr ==

{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}

There are many community projects for integrating Solr with many programming languages and environments.
