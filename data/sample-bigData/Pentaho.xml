'''Pentaho''' was founded in 2004 by five founders.
&lt;ref name="computerworlduk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="informationweek-grimes"/&gt; It offers a suite of [[open source]] [[Business Intelligence]] (BI) products called Pentaho Business Analytics providing [[data integration]], [[OLAP|OLAP services]], reporting, [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboarding]], [[data mining]] and [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] capabilities.&lt;ref name = "ovum-sheina"/&gt; Pentaho is headquartered in Orlando, FL, USA. &lt;ref name = "sfbt"/&gt;

== Overview ==
The Pentaho suite consists of two offerings, an enterprise and community edition.  The enterprise edition contains extra features not found in the community edition. The enterprise edition is obtained through an annual subscription and includes extra support services.  Pentaho's core offering is frequently enhanced by add-on products, usually in the form of plugins, from the company itself and also the broader community of users and enthusiasts.  The table below summarizes the most popular products and plugins in the Pentaho ecosystem.

=== Server Applications ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Product !! Offering !! Type !! Recent version !!Description
|-
|'''Pentaho BI Platform''' || EE, CE || Server Application || [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/Business%20Intelligence%20Server/4.8.0-stable/ 4.8.0] || Commonly referred to as the BI Platform, and recently renamed Business Analytics Platform (BA Platform), makes up the core software piece that hosts content created both in the server itself through plugins or files published to the server from the desktop applications.  It includes features for managing security, running reports, displaying dashboards, report bursting, scripted business rules, OLAP analysis and scheduling out of the box.  &lt;br&gt;Commercial plugins from Pentaho expand out-of-the-box features.  A few open-source plugin projects also expand capabilities of the server.  The Pentaho BA Platform runs in the Apache [[Application_server#Java_application_servers|Java Application Server]].  It can be embedded into other Java Application Servers.

|-
| '''Pentaho Analysis Services (Mondrian)''' || EE, CE || Server Application || [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mondrian/files/ 3.5.0] ||Pentaho Analysis Services, codenamed [[Mondrian OLAP server|Mondrian]],  is an [[open source]] [[Online analytical processing|OLAP]] (online analytical processing) [[Server (computing)|server]], written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].
It supports the [[MultiDimensional eXpressions|MDX]] (multidimensional expressions) query language and the [[XML for Analysis]] and [http://www.olap4j.org olap4j] interface specifications.  It reads from [[SQL]] and other data sources and aggregates data in a memory cache.  Mondrian can be run separately from the Pentaho BI Platform, but is always bundled with the platform itself in both EE and CE versions.

|-
| '''Pentaho Dashboard Designer (PDD)''' || EE || Server Plugin || 4.8-GA || A commercial plugin provided to enterprise edition (EE) subscribers.  It allows users to create [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboards]], which are collections of other content components displayed together with the goal of providing a centralized view of [[Key performance indicator| key performance indicators (KPI)s]] and other business data movements, letting users monitor them and make decisions.  Content components are usually individual [[Information graphics]], tables, OLAP views or reports.  The plugin simplifies dashboard creation through the use of layout templates, drag-and-drop interaction and a [[GUI]] for providing parameters and inputs to dashboard components.

|-
| '''Pentaho Analysis (Analyzer) (PAZ)''' || EE || Server Plugin || 4.8-GA || The Pentaho Analyzer plugin provides an advanced web based, drag-and-drop OLAP viewer. It allows a user to visually create MDX queries by dragging parts of a previously defined Mondrian OLAP schema onto a canvas, where other activities can take place like filtering, sorting, creating calculated members from other measures, exporting the result table to PDF or MS Excel, and optionally graphing the data.  It is also known to work on Apple iPads by using the Safari web browser.
|-
| '''Pentaho Interactive Reporting (PIR)''' || EE || Server Plugin || 4.8-GA || This plugin enables users to create [[Ad-hoc]] reports in a visual drag-and-drop fashion.
|-
| '''Pentaho Data Access Wizard''' ||EE,CE|| Server Plugin || 4.8-GA || This plugin is bundled with all servers and allows users to create new data sources for use throughout the system from other databases or CSV files uploaded to the server while using a setup wizard.  During the steps of creating a datasource users also are given a chance to create a data model describing how columns or fields relate to each other creating hierarchies of relationships like Time: Year, Quarters, Months, Weeks and Product Division, Category, Type etc.  The resultant model is used by Mondrian and any other plugin like Analyzer or Saiku to create new queries against the newly created data source.  This component is part of what Pentaho introduces as agile BI, which simply means having a way to start from basic data and quickly iterate through steps to discover the proper way to structure, study and present the data.&lt;ref name="pentahodataaccess"&gt;Michael Terallo, Pentaho [http://www.pentahoevalcenter.com/content-creation-delivery/data-access-wizard/ Data Access Wizard] Retrieved July 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| '''Pentaho Mobile''' ||EE|| Server Piece || 4.8-GA || A new addition since 4.5-GA suite that is a user interface adapted for use with the Apple iPad.  It exposes all of the major functionality of OLAP analysis and running of reports and dashboards that allow greater interaction on a small, touch screen. Mobile also adds features for bookmarking favorite content for easy access and the concept of opening several pieces of content in tabs.

|-
| '''Pentaho Metadata Editor (PME)''' || EE, CE || Desktop Application || [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/Pentaho Metadata/ 4.8] || The metadata editor is used to create business models and act as an abstraction layer from the underlying data sources.  The resulting metadata models are used by Pentaho Interactive Reporting, Saiku Reporting, and Pentaho's legacy AD-HOC reporting plugin applications to create reports within the BA server without using any of the other external desktop applications.
|-
| '''Pentaho Aggregate Designer (PAD)''' || EE, CE || Desktop Application || [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mondrian/files/aggregation%20designer/ 1.5.0] || Aggregate Designer operates on Pentaho Analysis (Mondrian) XML schema files and the database with the underlying tables described by the schema to generate precalculated, aggregated answers to speed up analysis work and MDX queries executed against Mondrian.  This is accomplished by the software examining the hierarchies described in the schema and the measures also defined there and generating SQL which would result in the creation of tables storing those answers away for future use by Mondrian.  After using the software to generate these aggregate tables, the original Mondrian XML schema file describing the OLAP cube is modified to reference the precomputed results.

|-
| '''Pentaho Schema Workbench (PSW)''' || EE, CE || Desktop Application || [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mondrian/files/schema%20workbench/ 3.5.0] || Pentaho Schema Workbench provides a graphical interface for designing OLAP cubes for Pentaho Analysis (Mondrian).  The schema created is stored as a regular XML file on disk.  It is not necessary to use the Schema Workbench to create schema, but it is often helpful for beginners and even experts who need go inspect a cube visually and come up to speed with how to maintain or extend it.

|-
| '''Pentaho Design Studio (PDS)''' || EE, CE || Desktop Application || [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/Design%20Studio/ 4.0] || The Pentaho BA Server supports special XML scripts called xactions to implement business logic and other forms of automation in the platform.  Design Studio is a modified version of the Eclipse Development Environment with a plugin designed to understand the components supported by xaction scripts.  Xactions are very powerful, and useful, but sometimes prove difficult to troubleshoot because of the low-level way they interact with parts of the BA server.  Developers are starting to use Pentaho Data Integration transformation files to carry out automation and business logic tasks.  The transformations can be run directly by the BA Server and visually debugged in Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) and are quickly gaining favor in the community over xactions. It is a small leap to imagine PDI transformations will eventually replace xactions entirely.
