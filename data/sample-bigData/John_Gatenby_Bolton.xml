'''John Gatenby Bolton''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;ref name="frs"&gt;{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1995.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5 June 1922 &amp;ndash; 6 July 1993) was a British-Australian [[astronomer]] from [[Sheffield]], England. He attended [[King Edward VII School (Sheffield)]], followed by [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] from 1940 to 1942, during which time he met [[C. P. Snow]]. After graduation he joined the navy, serving on [[HMS Unicorn (I72)|HMS ''Unicorn'']] during World War II. His ship went to Australia; he remained there after the war. In September 1946 he began working at the [[CSIRO]] Division of Radiophysics. At that time the field of [[radio astronomy]] was quite new and Bolton took the opportunity to become a pioneer in the field with experimentation at [[Dover Heights]]. His group found a number of radio sources in the sky, and realized that certain "radio stars" were actually located outside our [[galaxy]] and worked on mapping the structure of our galaxy.

He held a fellowship at [[Caltech]] beginning in 1955. In 1956, he resigned his position at CSIRO to become Professor of Radio Astronomy at Caltech, but he returned to Australia just a few years later to help build the [[Parkes radio telescope]]. This telescope found some distant radio sources now known to be [[quasar]]s. It also helped transmit the video of the first Moon landing by [[Neil Armstrong]].

He won the inaugural Jansky Prize&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrao.edu/jansky/janskyprize.shtml Jansky Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1966, the [[Henry Norris Russell Lectureship]] in 1968, the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1977 and the [[Bruce Medal]] in 1988. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] of London in March, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27bolton%27%29| title= Library and Archive catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
