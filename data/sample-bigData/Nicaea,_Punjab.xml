'''Nicaea''' was a city in what is now the present-day [[Mong, Punjab|Mong]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=6_ctAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Nicaea+Mong&amp;dq=Nicaea+Mong&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7i3GPP9Jep&amp;sig=scIQIw3Y3hsAeGyryYKrrPHaEEg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7Q83TNudGYW0lQe21dXSBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ The encyclop√¶dia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 14 p. 398]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the two cities founded by [[Alexander the Great]] on opposite sides of the [[Hydaspes]] river. The second city founded by Alexander on the Hydaspes was [[Alexandria Bucephalous|Bucephala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=OiM51I7_A1gC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=Alexander+Nicaea+Punjab&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6RM3TMPYMsH6lweKuODTBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Alexander%20Nicaea%20Punjab&amp;f=false Alexander the Great: a reader] Author Ian Worthington Editor Ian Worthington Edition illustrated, reprint Publisher Routledge, 2003 ISBN 0-415-29186-0, ISBN 978-0-415-29186-6 Length 332 pages p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_z2.html Alexander the Great: his towns]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]], Alexander founded two [[cities]]. One on the site of the battle he named Alexandria ''Niceae'' meaning ''Victory''. The site of that city is still undetermined and a number of candidates have been put forward for the location:

* Huntingford identifies this Alexandria with a large mound west of [[Jhelum]] city, while [[Jona Lendering|Lendering]] cites [[Jhelum]] in more general terms. [[Buddhist]] tradition mentions an unnamed city south of Jhelum that some speculate may have been Nicaea.
* The [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[archaeologist]] and [[Silk Road]] expert [[Aurel Stein|Sir Marc Aurel Stein]] believed that instead of using the [[Grand Trunk Road|road]] from [[Taxila]] to [[Jhelum]] which dates from [[medieval]] times, Alexander's army went [[south]] to cross the [[Jhelum River|river]] near modern [[Bhera]].  At this site the [[battle]] would have happened near the town of [[Mong, Punjab|Mong]]. The [[topography]], river orientation and natural features including [[Salt Range|salt cliffs]] in this vicinity match closely the description given in ancient sources.


:Further supporting this location is the traditional claim by the residents of Mong and nearby [[Phalia]] that Mong is [[Hellenistic]]  Nicaea. The historian and [[BBC]] presenter [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]] supports Stein's claims about Mong.
