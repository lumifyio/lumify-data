The trend to larger data sets is due to the additional information derivable from analysis of a single large set of related data, as compared to separate smaller sets with the same total amount of data, allowing correlations to be found to "spot business trends, determine quality of research, prevent diseases, [[legal citation analysis|link legal citations]], combat crime, and determine real-time roadway traffic conditions."{{r|Economist}}&lt;ref name=BD-HB-R-01&gt;{{cite web|title=E-Discovery Special Report: The Rising Tide of Nonlinear Review|url=http://hudsonlegalblog.com/e-discovery/e-discovery-special-report-rising-tide-nonlinear-review.html|publisher=[[Hudson Global]]|accessdate=1 July 2012}} by Cat Casey and Alejandra Perez&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BD-HB-R-02&gt;{{cite web|title=What Technology-Assisted Electronic Discovery Teaches Us About The Role Of Humans In Technology&amp;nbsp;— Re-Humanizing Technology-Assisted Review|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkerschberg/2012/01/09/what-technology-assisted-electronic-discovery-teaches-us-about-the-role-of-humans-in-technology/|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big data is difficult to work with using most relational database management systems and desktop statistics and visualization packages, requiring instead "massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jacobs, A. |title=The Pathologies of Big Data |date=6 July 2009 |work=ACMQueue |url=http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1563874}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered "big data" varies depending on the capabilities of the organization managing the set, and on the capabilities of the applications that are traditionally used to process and analyze the data set in its domain. "For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Magoulas |first1=Roger |last2=Lorica |first2=Ben |title=Introduction to Big Data |journal=Release 2.0 |issue=11 |date=February 2009 |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/r2/release2-0-11.html |publisher=O’Reilly Media |location=Sebastopol CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to [[data acquisition|capture]], [[data curation|curate]], manage, and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time.&lt;ref name="Editorial"&gt;Snijders, C., Matzat, U., &amp; Reips, U.-D. (2012). ‘Big Data’: Big gaps of knowledge in the field of Internet. ''International Journal of Internet Science, 7'', 1-5. http://www.ijis.net/ijis7_1/ijis7_1_editorial.html&lt;/ref&gt; Big data sizes are a constantly moving target, {{As of|2012|lc=on}} ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many [[petabyte]]s of data in a single data set.  The target moves due to constant improvement in traditional DBMS technology as well as new databases like [[NoSQL]] and their ability to handle larger amounts of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hogan, M. |title=Large Databases |date=3 Jan 2013 |url=http://www.scaledb.com/large-database.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this difficulty, new platforms of "big data" tools are being developed to handle various aspects of large quantities of data.

In a 2001 research report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Laney |last=Douglas |title=3D Data Management: Controlling Data Volume, Velocity and Variety |url=http://blogs.gartner.com/doug-laney/files/2012/01/ad949-3D-Data-Management-Controlling-Data-Volume-Velocity-and-Variety.pdf |publisher=Gartner |accessdate = 6 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related lectures, [[META Group]] (now [[Gartner]]) analyst Doug Laney defined data growth challenges and opportunities as being three-dimensional, i.e. increasing volume (amount of data), velocity (speed of data in and out), and variety (range of data types and sources). Gartner, and now much of the industry, continue to use this "3Vs" model for describing big data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Beyer |first=Mark |title=Gartner Says Solving 'Big Data' Challenge Involves More Than Just Managing Volumes of Data |url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1731916 |publisher=Gartner |accessdate = 13 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110710043533/http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1731916| archivedate= 10 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Gartner]] updated its definition as follows: "Big data are high volume, high velocity, and/or high variety information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery and process optimization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Laney |last=Douglas |title=The Importance of 'Big Data': A Definition |url=http://www.gartner.com/resId=2057415 |publisher=Gartner |accessdate = 21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a new V "Veracity" is added by some organizations to describe it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Big Data?|url=http://www.villanovau.com/university-online-programs/what-is-big-data/|publisher=[[Villanova University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Gartner’s definition (the 3Vs) is still widely used, the growing maturity of the concept fosters a more sound difference between Big Data and [[Business Intelligence]], regarding data and their use:
* Business Intelligence uses [[descriptive statistics]] with data with high information density to measure things, detect trends etc.;
* Big Data uses [[inductive statistics]] with data with low information density &lt;ref&gt;Delort P., Big data Paris 2013 http://www.andsi.fr/tag/dsi-big-data/&lt;/ref&gt; whose huge volume allow to infer laws (regressions…) and thus giving (with the limits of inference reasoning) to Big Data some predictive capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Delort P., Big Data car Low-Density Data ?

===Big science===
The  [[Large Hadron Collider]] experiments represent about 150 million sensors delivering data 40 million times per second. There are nearly 600 million collisions per second. After filtering and refraining from recording more than 99.999% of these streams, there are 100 collisions of interest per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LHC Brochure, English version.

* As a result, only working with less than 0.001% of the sensor stream data, the data flow from all four LHC experiments represents 25 petabytes annual rate before replication (as of 2012). This becomes nearly 200 petabytes after replication.
* If all sensor data were to be recorded in LHC, the data flow would be extremely hard to work with. The data flow would exceed 150 million petabytes annual rate, or nearly 500 [[exabytes]] per day, before replication. To put the number in perspective, this is equivalent to 500 [[quintillion]] (5×10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) bytes per day, almost 200 times higher than all the other sources combined in the world.

===Science and research===
* When the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS) began collecting astronomical data in 2000, it amassed more in its first few weeks than all data collected in the history of astronomy. Continuing at a rate of about 200 GB per night, SDSS has amassed more than 140 terabytes of information. When the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]], successor to SDSS, comes online in 2016 it is anticipated to acquire that amount of data every five days.{{r|Economist}}
* Decoding the [[Human Genome Project|human genome]] originally took 10 years to process, now it can be achieved in less than a week : the DNA sequencers have divided the sequencing cost by 10 000 in the last ten years, which is a factor 100 compared to Moore's Law.&lt;ref&gt;Delort P., OECD ICCP Technology Foresight Forum, 2012. http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/Session_3_Delort.pdf#page=6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Computational social science&amp;nbsp;— [[Tobias Preis]] ''et al.'' used [[Google Trends]] data to demonstrate that Internet users from countries with a higher per capita gross domestic product (GDP) are more likely to search for information about the future than information about the past.

The results hint that there may potentially be a relationship between the economic success of a country and the information-seeking behavior of its citizens captured in big data.

===International development===
Following decades of work in the area of the effective usage of [[information and communication technologies for development]] (or [[ICT4D]]), it has been suggested that Big Data can make important contributions to [[international development]].&lt;ref&gt;UN GLobal Pulse (2012). Big Data for Development: Opportunities and Challenges (White p. by Letouzé, E.). New York: United Nations. Retrieved from http://www.unglobalpulse.org/projects/BigDataforDevelopment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WEF (World Economic Forum), &amp; Vital Wave Consulting. (2012). Big Data, Big Impact: New Possibilities for International Development. World Economic Forum. Retrieved August 24, 2012, from http://www.weforum.org/reports/big-data-big-impact-new-possibilities-international-development&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, the advent of Big Data delivers the cost-effective prospect to improve decision-making in critical development areas such as [[health care]], [[employment]], [[economic productivity]], crime and security, and [[natural disaster]] and resource management.&lt;ref name="HilbertBigData2013"/&gt; On the other hand, all the well-known concerns of the Big Data debate, such as privacy, interoperability challenges, and the almighty power of imperfect algorithms, are aggravated in developing countries by long-standing development challenges like lacking technological infrastructure and economic and human resource scarcity. "This has the potential to result in a new kind of [[digital divide]]: a divide in data-based intelligence to inform decision-making."&lt;ref name="HilbertBigData2013"/&gt;

==Market==
"Big data" has increased the demand of information management specialists in that [[Software AG]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[EMC Corporation|EMC]],  and [[HP]] have spent more than $15 billion on software firms only specializing in data management and analytics. In 2010, this industry on its own was worth more than $100 billion and was growing at almost 10&amp;nbsp;percent a year: about twice as fast as the software business as a whole.{{r|Economist}}

Developed economies make increasing use of data-intensive technologies. There are 4.6 billion mobile-phone subscriptions worldwide and there are between 1 billion and 2 billion people accessing the internet.{{r|Economist}} Between 1990 and 2005, more than 1 billion people worldwide entered the middle class which means more and more people who gain money will become more literate which in turn leads to information growth. The world's effective capacity to exchange information through [[telecommunication]] networks was 281 [[petabytes]] in 1986, 471 [[petabytes]] in 1993, 2.2 [[exabytes]] in 2000, 65 [[exabytes]] in 2007&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt; and it is predicted that the amount of traffic flowing over the internet will reach 667 [[exabyte]]s annually by 2013.{{r|Economist}}

==Architecture==
In 2004, Google published a paper on a process called [[MapReduce]] that used such an architecture. MapReduce framework provides a parallel programming model and associated implementation to process huge amount of data.  With MapReduce, queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel (the Map step). The results are then gathered and delivered (the Reduce step). The framework was incredibly successful,{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} so others wanted to replicate the algorithm. Therefore, an implementation of MapReduce framework was adopted by an Apache open source project named [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster, John. [http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf "MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters"], "Search Storage", 2004. Retrieved on 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MIKE2.0 Methodology|MIKE2.0]] is an open approach to information management. The methodology addresses handling big data in terms of useful [[permutation]]s of data sources, [[complexity]] in interrelationships, and difficulty in deleting (or modifying) individual records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/Big_Data_Definition|title=Big Data Definition|publisher=MIKE2.0|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some but not all MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data. Implicit is the ability to load, monitor, back up, and optimize the use of the large data tables in the [[RDBMS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Monash, Curt |title=eBay’s two enormous data warehouses |date=30 April 2009 |url=http://www.dbms2.com/2009/04/30/ebays-two-enormous-data-warehouses/}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |author=Monash, Curt |title=eBay followup&amp;nbsp;— Greenplum out, Teradata &gt; 10 petabytes, Hadoop has some value, and more |date=6 October 2010 |url=http://www.dbms2.com/2010/10/06/ebay-followup-greenplum-out-teradata-10-petabytes-hadoop-has-some-value-and-more/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DARPA’s Topological Data Analysis program seeks the fundamental structure of massive data sets and in 2008 the technology went public with the launch of a company called [[Ayasdi]].

The practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Storage area networks need not apply |author=CNET News |date=April 1, 2011 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-21546_3-20049693-10253464.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring direct-attached storage (DAS) in its various forms from solid state disk (SSD) to high capacity SATA disk buried inside parallel processing nodes. The perception of shared storage architectures—SAN and NAS—is that they are relatively slow, complex, and expensive. These qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that thrive on system performance, commodity infrastructure, and low cost.

Real or near-real time information delivery is one of the defining characteristics of big data analytics. Latency is therefore avoided whenever and wherever possible. Data in memory is good—data on spinning disk at the other end of a FC SAN connection is not. The cost of a SAN at the scale needed for analytics applications is very much higher than other storage techniques.

There are advantages as well as disadvantages to shared storage in big data analytics, but big data analytics practitioners {{As of|2011|lc=on}} did not favour it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How New Analytic Systems will Impact Storage |date=September 2011 |url=http://www.evaluatorgroup.com/document/big-data-how-new-analytic-systems-will-impact-storage-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research activities==
In March 2012, The White House announced a national "Big Data Initiative" that consisted of six Federal departments and agencies committing more than $200 million to big data research projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Obama Administration Unveils "Big Data" Initiative:Announces $200 Million In New R&amp;D Investments|publisher=The White House |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/big_data_press_release_final_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative included a National Science Foundation "Expeditions in Computing" grant of $10 million over 5 years to the AMPLab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu |title=AMPLab at the University of California, Berkeley |publisher=Amplab.cs.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSF Leads Federal Efforts In Big Data|date=29 March 2012|publisher=National Science Foundation (NSF) |url=http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=123607&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMPLab also received funds from DARPA, and over a dozen industrial sponsors and uses big data to attack a wide range of problems from predicting traffic congestion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/publication/scaling-the-mobile-millennium-system-in-the-cloud-2/|author1=Timothy Hunter|date=October 2011|author2=Teodor Moldovan|author3=Matei Zaharia|author4=Justin Ma|author5=Michael Franklin|author6=Pieter Abbeel|author7=Alexandre Bayen|title=Scaling the Mobile Millennium System in the Cloud}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fighting cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer Scientists May Have What It Takes to Help Cure Cancer|author=David Patterson|publisher=The New York Times|date=5 December 2011|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/science/david-patterson-enlist-computer-scientists-in-cancer-fight.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White House Big Data Initiative also included a commitment by the  Department of Energy to provide $25 million in funding over 5 years to establish the Scalable Data Management, Analysis and Visualization (SDAV) Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretary Chu Announces New Institute to Help Scientists Improve Massive Data Set Research on DOE Supercomputers |publisher="energy.gov" |url=http://energy.gov/articles/secretary-chu-announces-new-institute-help-scientists-improve-massive-data-set-research-doe}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by the Energy Department’s [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. The SDAV Institute aims to bring together the expertise of six national laboratories and seven universities to develop new tools to help scientists manage and visualize data on the Department’s supercomputers.

The U.S. state of [[Massachusetts]] announced the Massachusetts Big Data Initiative in May 2012, which provides funding from the state government and private companies to a variety of research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Governor Patrick announces new initiative to strengthen Massachusetts’ position as a World leader in Big Data |publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts |url=http://www.mass.gov/governor/pressoffice/pressreleases/2012/2012530-governor-announces-big-data-initiative.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] hosts the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data in the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], combining government, corporate, and institutional funding and research efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigdata.csail.mit.edu/ |title=Big Data @ CSAIL |publisher=Bigdata.csail.mit.edu |date=2013-02-22 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission is funding a 2-year-long [http://big-project.eu Big Data Public Private Forum] through their [[Seventh Framework Program]] to engage companies, academics and other stakeholders in discussing Big Data issues. The project aims to define a strategy in terms of research and innovation to guide supporting actions from the European Commission in the successful implementation of the Big Data economy. Outcomes of this project will be used as input for [http://ec.europa.eu/research/horizon2020/index_en.cfm?pg=h2020 Horizon 2020], their next [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|framework program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=proj.document&amp;PJ_RCN=13267529 |title=Big Data Public Private Forum |publisher=Cordis.europa.eu |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Critiques of the Big Data paradigm come in two flavors, those that question the implications of the approach itself, and those that question the way it is currently done.

===Critiques of the Big Data paradigm===
"A crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical micro-processes that lead to the emergence of the[se] typical network characteristics of Big Data".&lt;ref name="Editorial" /&gt; In their critique, Snijders, Matzat, and [[Ulf-Dietrich Reips|Reips]] point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of micro-processes. Mark Graham has leveled broad critiques at [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson's]] assertion that big data will spell the end of theory: focusing in particular on the notion that big data will always need to be contextualized in their social, economic and political contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Graham M. |title=Big data and the end of theory? |newspaper=The Guardian |year=2012 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/mar/09/big-data-theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even as companies invest eight- and nine-figure sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers, less than 40% of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so. To overcome this insight deficit, "big data", no matter how comprehensive or well analyzed, needs to be complemented by "big judgment", according to an article in the Harvard Business Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Data Won't Guarantee Good Decisions. Harvard Business Review|url=http://hbr.org/2012/04/good-data-wont-guarantee-good-decisions/ar/1|work=Shah, Shvetank; Horne, Andrew; Capellá, Jaime;|publisher=HBR.org|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much in the same line, it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of Big Data are inevitably "informed by the world as it was in the past, or, at best, as it currently is".&lt;ref name="HilbertBigData2013"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2205145 "Big Data for Development: From Information- to Knowledge Societies"], Martin Hilbert (2013), SSRN Scholarly Paper No. ID 2205145). Rochester, NY: Social Science Research Network; http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2205145&lt;/ref&gt;  Fed by a large number of data on past experiences, algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past. If the systems dynamics of the future change, the past can say little about the future. For this, it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic, which implies theory.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C. (2008, June 23). The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete. Wired Magazine, (Science: Discoveries). http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory&lt;/ref&gt;  As a response to this critique it has been suggested to combine Big Data approaches with computer simulations, such as [[agent-based model]]s, for example.&lt;ref name="HilbertBigData2013"/&gt; {{citation needed span|text=Those are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms.|reason=This is a very ambitious statement and further references are needed to corroborate whether and how it accurately represents current research in agent-based models.|date=June 2013}} In addition, use of multivariate methods that probe for the latent structure of the data, such as [[factor analysis]] and [[cluster analysis]], have proven useful as analytic approaches that go well beyond the bi-variate approaches (cross-tabs) typically employed with smaller data sets.

In Health and biology, conventional scientific approaches are based on experimentation. For these approaches, the limiting factor are the relevant data that can confirm or refute the initial hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Delort P., Big data in Biosciences, Big Data Paris, 2012 http://www.bigdataparis.com/documents/Pierre-Delort-INSERM.pdf#page=5&lt;/ref&gt;
A new postulate is accepted now in biosciences : the information provided by the data in huge volumes ([[omics]]) without prior hypothesis is complementary and sometimes necessary to conventional approaches based on experimentation.
In the massive approaches it is the formulation of a relevant hypothesis to explain the data that is the limiting factor. The search logic is reversed and the limits of induction ("Glory of Science and Philosophy scandal", [[C. D. Broad]], 1926) to be considered.

[[Consumer privacy]] advocates are concerned about the threat to privacy represented by increasing storage and integration of [[personally identifiable information]]; expert panels have released various policy recommendations to conform practice to expectations of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Ohm |title=Don't Build a Database of Ruin |publisher=Harvard Business Review |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/08/dont_build_a_database_of_ruin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This data comes from digital pictures, videos, posts to social media sites, intelligent sensors, purchase transaction records, cell phone GPS signals to name a few. This is Big Data. There is a great interest both in the commercial and in the research communities around Big Data. It has been predicted that “analyzing Big Data will become a key basis of competition, underpinning new waves of productivity growth, innovation, and consumer surplus”, according to research by MGI and McKinsey’s Business Technology Office.
