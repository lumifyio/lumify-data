'''Eureka Streams''' is a [[Free software|free]], [[open source]] enterprise social networking platform developed by [[Lockheed Martin]].  [[Activity stream]]s and [[software widget|gadgets]] make up its core functionality.  Content within Eureka Streams consists primarily of [[Microblogging|microblogs]] and internal and external [[web feed]]s. Users typically provide [[Hyperlink|links]] to other content, such as [[wiki]]s, [[blog]]s, and shared documents housed in a [[content management system]].

==Technical architecture==
Eureka Streams uses a [[shared nothing architecture]].  It uses [[Memcached]], [[Apache Maven]], [[PostgreSQL]] and [[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]]. It uses [[Shindig (software)|Shindig]] for [[OpenSocial]].

It makes use of [[Java Message Service]] (JMS), [[Java Persistence API]] (JPA), [[Lucene]] and [[Google Web Toolkit]] (GWT). It makes use of the [[Apache JServ Protocol]] (AJP), [[OAuth]] and [[Representational State Transfer]] (REST).

==History==
The development of the Eureka Streams software began at Lockheed Martin in early 2009.  The open source project was first announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2009/070709_LMtoReleaseSocialMediaOpenSource.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; publicly at the Enterprise 2.0 Conference in Boston, Massachusetts in July 2009.  However, the name "Eureka Streams" was chosen later that summer and subsequently revealed publicly with the open source project announcement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2010/0726isgs-eureka.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on July 26, 2010.

The core team behind Eureka Streams resides in the CIO Office of Lockheed Martin Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions.  Its principal members include Shawn Dahlen, Chris Keohane, Brian H. Mayo, Steve Terlecki, Blake Caldwell, Chad Scott, Rob Keane, and Anthony Romano

When the open source project was first announced, the open source community initially reacted with some surprise.  This is partly due the fact that the originating company is a large aerospace &amp; defense company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton |first=Kit |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1677663/lockheed-martin-social-networking-unity-employees-secrecy |title=Lockheed Martin's Social Networking Platform's Not Rocket Science |publisher=Fast Company |date=2010-08-04 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the project apparently bucked the trend of fewer enterprises participating in open source projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodrigues |first=Savio |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source/5-lessons-win-win-open-source-projects-163?page=0,0&amp;source=rss_the_industry_standard |title=5 lessons for win-win open source projects &amp;#124; Open Source |publisher=InfoWorld |date=2010-07-30 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
