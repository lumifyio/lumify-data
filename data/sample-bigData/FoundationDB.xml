'''FoundationDB''' is a [[NoSQL]] database with a [[shared nothing architecture]].&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/03/foundationdb/ Database House Wants You to Stop Dropping ACID]&lt;/ref&gt; The product is designed around a "core" database, with additional features supplied in "layers."&lt;ref name="h-online"&gt;[http://www.h-online.com/developer/news/item/FoundationDB-releases-beta-of-its-NoSQL-YesACID-database-1816279.html FoundationDB Releases Beta of its 'NoSQL/YesACID' Database]&lt;/ref&gt; The core database exposes an ordered key-value store with [[Database transactions|transactions]].&lt;ref name="datanami"&gt;[http://www.datanami.com/datanami/2013-03-04/foundationdb_s_acid_compliant_nosql_available.html FoundationDB's ACID Compliant NoSQL Available]&lt;/ref&gt; The transactions are able to read or write multiple keys stored on any machine in the cluster while fully supporting [[ACID]] properties.&lt;ref name="readwrite"&gt;[http://readwrite.com/2013/03/08/foundationdbs-nosql-breakthrough-challenges-relational-database-dominance FoundationDB's NoSQL Breakthrough Challenges Relational Database Dominance]&lt;/ref&gt; Transactions are used to implement a variety of data models via layers.

The FoundationDB Alpha program began in January 2012 and concluded on March 4, 2013 with their public Beta 1 release.&lt;ref name="sdt"&gt;[http://sdt.bz/41498 FoundationDB Brings Transactions to NoSQL]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main features ==

The main features of FoundationDB include the following:

;Ordered key-value store
:In addition to supporting standard key-based reads and writes, the ordering property enables range reads that can efficiently scan large swaths of data.&lt;ref name="datanami"/&gt;

;Transactions
:Transaction processing employs [[multiversion concurrency control]] for reads and [[Optimistic concurrency control|optimistic]] concurrency for writes. Transactions can span multiple keys stored on multiple machines.

;ACID properties
:FoundationDB guarantees [[Serializability|serializable]] [[Isolation (database systems)|isolation]] and strong [[Durability (database systems)|durability]] via redundant storage on disk before transactions are considered [[Commit (data management)|committed]].

;Layers
:Layers map new data models, APIs, and query languages to the FoundationDB core. They employ FoundationDB's ability to update multiple data elements in a single transaction, ensuring consistency.&lt;ref name="h-online"/&gt;

;Commodity clusters
:FoundationDB is designed for deployment on distributed clusters of [[Commodity computing|commodity]] hardware running [[Linux]].&lt;ref name="zdnet"&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/foundationdb-releases-new-nosql-data-platform-7000012102/ FoundationdB Releases New NoSQL Data Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Replication
:FoundationDB stores each piece of data on multiple machines according to a configurable replication factor. Triple replication is the recommended mode for clusters of 5 or more machines.

;Scalability
:FoundationDB is designed to support [[Scalability#Horizontal_and_vertical_scaling|horizontal scaling]] though the addition of machines to a cluster while automatically handling data replication and partitioning.

;Systems supported
:FoundationDB supports packages for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. The Linux version supports production clusters, while the Windows and Mac OS X versions support local operation for development purposes. Configurations on Amazon [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud|EC2]] are also supported.&lt;ref name="cio"/&gt;

;Language support
:FoundationDB supports language bindings for Python, Ruby, Node.js, Java, and C, all of which are made available with the product.&lt;ref name="cio"/&gt;

== History ==

FoundationDB, headquartered in Vienna, VA,&lt;ref name="cio"&gt;[http://www.cio.com/article/729809/FoundationDB_Aims_to_Consolidate_NoSQL FoundationDB Aims to Consolidate NoSQL]&lt;/ref&gt; was started in 2009 by Nick Lavezzo, Dave Rosenthal, and Dave Scherer, drawing on their experience in executive and technology roles at their previous company, Visual Sciences.&lt;ref name="venturebeat"&gt;[http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/04/foundationdb-launches-its-best-of-both-worlds-database/ SQL or NoSQL: FoundationDB Launches a 'Best of Both Worlds' Database]&lt;/ref&gt;
