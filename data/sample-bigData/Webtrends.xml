===Webtrends Analytics===

The core product, Webtrends Analytics, is available in both software and [[software as a service]] (SaaS) models.

===Webtrends Visitor Data Mart===

At the core of this tool is comprehensive "Interest Profile" that combines a unique visitor's online behavior with offline customer data, such as CRM or demographics, to build insight into that person over time. This insight, combined with analysis and multi-dimensional reporting, gives enterprise organizations the ability to answer questions that are critical to improving marketing ROI.

===Data Collection Technology===
There are two main technological approaches to collecting the data:
*'''Log File Analysis''' - Reads the log files in which the web server records all its transactions.
*'''Page Tagging''' -  Parameter name/value pairs are appended (either automatically by a JavaScript "tag" or manual hand-coding) to the query string of a [[gif]] image which resides on a data collection server. When a visitor loads the page in a browser, the browser sends a request to the data collection server so that it may load the gif image. The data collection server receives the request and logs the parameters included in the query string of the gif image.

The software analyzes and organizes the captured data into reports for each configured 'Profile'. Reports are viewable by various means, most commonly through a web-based [[graphic user interface]] or a scheduled emailed export of the report in [[PDF]] or [[Comma-separated values|csv]] format. Collected data can also be viewed via raw log file delivery, [[REST]] and [[ODBC]] queries, and other solutions which utilize the Webtrends Data Extraction API. The web-based report presentation interface is highly configurable, allowing a Webtrends administrator to specify what information should be analyzed, where it should be presented, and to whom it should be available for viewing.

== Corporate history ==
W. Glen Boyd and Eli Shapira founded the company in 1995 as  "e.g. Software".&lt;ref name=PBJ-2007-11-01&gt;{{cite news | first= Aliza| last= Earnshaw| coauthors= | title=Webtrends sale not imminent | date=2007-11-01 | publisher= | url =http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2007/10/29/daily39.html | work =www.bizjournals.com/portland | pages = | accessdate = 2011-10-16 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 they took it public, raising $45.5 million.&lt;ref name=PBJ-2007-11-01/&gt; In 2001 California company NetIQ bought Webtrends for $1.1 billion in stock, then sold it to Francisco Partners four years later for $94 million.&lt;ref name=PBJ-2007-11-01/&gt;

On October 31, 2007, three corporate vice presidents and the [[CEO]] were asked to resign.&lt;ref name='Portland Business Journal 2007-10-31'&gt;{{cite news | first= Aliza| last= Earnshaw| coauthors= | title=Webtrends CEO gone | date=2007-10-31 | publisher= | url =http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2007/10/29/daily29.html | work =www.bizjournals.com/portland | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-03 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was initial speculation the company was to be quickly sold to its largest competitor, later reports indicated the change signaled a long-term move.&lt;ref name=PBJ-2007-11-01/&gt;

== Acquisitions ==
Webtrends acquired ClickShift, an automated optimization solution in online advertising, in December 2006.&lt;ref name='Portland Business Journal 2006-12-04'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Webtrends Acquires ClickShift | date=2006-12-04 | publisher= | url =http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2006/12/04/daily2.html | work =www.bizjournals.com/portland | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-31 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ClickShift's technology was integrated into Webtrends' Marketing Lab suite, which includes its analytics and marketing warehouse products.

Webtrends acquired Seattle based Widemile, a provider of multivariate testing and targeting on July 30, 2009.

Webtrends acquired San Francisco based Transpond, a maker of social microsites and applications that can be distributed over the web or [[Facebook]], on August 10, 2010. The product was rebranded as Webtrends Apps at the time of the announcement and was later rebranded as Webtrends Social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Webtrends-Acquires-Social-Marketing-Company-Transpond-1302371.htm | title = Webtrends Acquires Social Marketing Company Transpond. | accessdate = 2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.webtrends.com/AboutWebtrends/NewsRoom/NewsRoomArchive/2011/WebtrendsAnnouncesAvailabilityOfNewPrice-ShatteringSocialSuite | title = Webtrends Announces Availability Of New Price-Shattering Social Suite. | accessdate = 2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webtrends acquired Reinvigorate from Culver City, CA based Media Temple Ventures. Reinvigorate developed a real time analytics web solution with visit heat mapping technologies. The product has yet to be rebranded into the Webtrends portfolio as of 8/27/2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.webtrends.com/AboutWebtrends/NewsRoom/NewsRoomArchive/2011/WebtrendsAcquiresReinvigorateCombinesBigDataScalabilityWithReal-TimeAnalytics | title = Webtrends Acquires Reinvigorate - Combines Big Data Scalability with Real-Time Analytics. | accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2009, Webtrends launched a transit ad campaign revolving around whether or not cyclists should pay a [[road tax]]. The ad asked, "Should Cyclists Pay A Road Tax?".&lt;ref name="oregonlive"&gt;{{cite news | title=New full-train MAX ad asks: Should cyclists pay road tax? | date=2009-07-02 | url =http://blog.oregonlive.com/commuting/2009/07/new_max_ad_should_cyclists_pay.html | accessdate = 2009-07-03 | work=The Oregonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both drivers and the cycling community reacted strongly to the ad, with strident opinion on both sides of the debate.&lt;ref name="O"/&gt; The aim of the campaign was to demonstrate the ability of the company's Web analytics to track the resulting online commentary around the issue.&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2009/07/ads_on_bike_road_tax_have_bike.html |title=Ads on bike tax have cyclists fuming |last=Rogoway |first=Mike |date=Thursday July 02, 2009 |work=[[OregonLive.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
