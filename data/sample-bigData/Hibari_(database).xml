'''Hibari''' is a strongly consistent, highly available, distributed, key-value [[Big Data]] store. ([[NoSQL]] database) &lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/hibari/hibari Hibari project homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by '''Cloudian, Inc.''', formerly Gemini Mobile Technologies to support its mobile messaging and email services and released as [[open source]] on July 27, 2010.

Hibari, a Japanese name meaning "Cloud Bird", can be used in [[cloud computing]] with services&amp;mdash;such as [[social networking]]&amp;mdash;requiring the daily storage of potentially [[terabyte]]s or [[petabyte]]s of new data.

==Distinctive Features==
Hibari uses chain replication for strong consistency, high-availability, and durability. Unlike many other [[NoSQL]] variants, Hibari support micro-transaction, which is ACID transaction within a certain range of keys.

Hibari has excellent performance especially for read and large value (around 200KB) operations.

==Interfaces==
Hibari supports APIs such as [[Amazon S3]], [[JSON-RPC]] and Universal Binary Protocol; plans have been announced for support of [[Apache Thrift]]; in addition to [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]], the language it was developed in. Hibari supports [[language binding]]s such as [[Java (software platform)|Java]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].
