==Products==
Splunk's core products (also called '''Splunk'''), can perform real-time and historical search, as well as reporting and statistical analysis.  The product can index structured or unstructured textual machine-generated data. Search and analytics operations are specified using [[SPL (Search Processing Language)|SPL]] ('''Search Processing Language'''), created for managing [[Machine-generated data|machine-generated]] [[big data]].  Originally based upon [[Pipeline (Unix)|Unix Piping]] and [[SQL]], its scope includes data searching, filtering, modification, manipulation, insertion, and deletion.

In 2011, Splunk introduced '''Splunk Storm''', a cloud-based version of the core Splunk product, which offers a turnkey, managed and hosted service for machine data.

==Licensing==
Splunk offers its main software in two [[Software license|license]] types: an '''Enterprise License''' designed for companies and large organizations, and a '''Free License'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/nsm/2009/110209nsm1.html Cash in on free IT management software for a limited time only, Denise Dubie, Network World, November 01, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkreading.com/security/management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=217800973 Free SIM Tools Save Money -- And Maybe Your Data, John Sar, DarkReading, June 12, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; designed for personal use. The [[freeware]] version is limited to 500&amp;nbsp;MB of data a day, and lacks some features of the Enterprise license edition.

'''Splunk Storm''' is offered in both free and paid versions. Users can increase or decrease project storage size as desired.
