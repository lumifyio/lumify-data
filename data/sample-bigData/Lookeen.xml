'''Lookeen''' is a search add-on for [[Microsoft Outlook]], produced under shareware license. The program uses [[Apache Software Foundation|Apache]]s search engine [[Lucene]].

==Using==
Lookeen is an add-on for Microsoft Outlook. The program is developed according to the Microsoft company recommendation on the add-ons design. After installation the program automatically integrates into Microsoft Outlook workspace

==Supported mailbox storages==
Lookeen supports the following types of mail accounts: [[POP3]], [[IMAP]], HTTP and [[Microsoft Exchange Server]]. Both uncached and cached exchange server modes are supported.

[64bit tends to crash Outlook]

==Central indexing==
Version 2.0 supports central indexing of shared resources (e.g. network files, public exchange folders). This shared index is created once and integrated by the clients via its URL. Goal is to reduce network- and server-traffic and reduce the index storage cost for local indexes.

[cached] is limited in its usage, the update of the files won't work

==Enterprise roll out support==
Version 2.0 supports [[Group Policies]] for advanced roll out: Many Options (e.g. Index location, Settings location, included sources, index intervals, license keys, etc.) can be defined by the administrator. That enables enterprises to use Lookeen in large [[Terminal Server]] or [[Citrix]] environments.

[note: not every group policy setting is supported]
