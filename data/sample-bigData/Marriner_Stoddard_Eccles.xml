'''Marriner Stoddard Eccles''' (September 9, 1890 &amp;ndash; December 18, 1977) was a [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[banker]], [[economist]], and member and [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|chairman]] of the [[Federal Reserve Board]].

==Biography==
Marriner Stoddard Eccles was known during his lifetime chiefly as having been the Chairman of the Federal Reserve under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He has been remembered for having even anticipated and certainly then having supported the theories of [[John Maynard Keynes]] relative to [[Demand (economics)#Demand management in economics|"inadequate aggregate spending"]] in the economy which appeared during his tenure.&lt;ref name=TR01&gt;[[Richard Timberlake|Timberlake, Richard]], [http://minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=3562 "The Tale of Another Chairman:] ... [T]he legacy of [[William McChesney Martin |W.M. Martin]] and Marriner Eccles, former Fed chairmen", ''The Region'' ([[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]] magazine), June 1999. Retrieved 2012-03-29.&lt;/ref&gt; As Eccles wrote in his memoir ''Beckoning Frontiers'' (1966): 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As mass production has to be accompanied by mass consumption, mass consumption, in turn, implies a distribution of wealth ... to provide men with buying power. ... Instead of achieving that kind of distribution, a giant suction pump had by 1929-30 drawn into a few hands an increasing portion of currently produced wealth. ... The other fellows could stay in the game only by borrowing. When their credit ran out, the game stopped."&lt;ref&gt;Eccles, Marriner S.; Hyman, Sydney (ed.), ''Beckoning Frontiers: Public and Personal Recollections'', (NY: Alfred A. Knopf, [http://www.amazon.com/Beckoning-frontiers-Public-personal-recollections/dp/B0006DBTXI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333054798&amp;sr=8-1 1951] [[ASIN]] B0006DBTXI; [http://www.amazon.com/Beckoning-Frontiers-Marriner-S-Eccles/dp/B001J2HOG6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333054798&amp;sr=8-3 1966] ASIN B001J2HOG6). 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Born in [[Logan, Utah]], he attended [[Brigham Young College]] and served a [[Latter-day Saint]] mission to [[Scotland]]. After his mission, while working in a family enterprise in Blacksmith Fork Canyon, he learned of the untimely death of his father. With great skill and tenacity, he was able to reorganize and consolidate the assets of the industrial [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] and banking network of his father, [[David Eccles (businessman)|David Eccles]]. Eccles expanded the banking interests into a large western chain of banks called Eccles-Browning Affiliated Banks. He was a millionaire by age 22. The company withstood several [[bank run]]s during the [[Great Depression]] and, as a leading banker, Eccles became involved with the creation of the [[Emergency Banking Act]] of 1933 and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]].  After a brief stint at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] and with the support of treasury secretary [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], Eccles was appointed by President Roosevelt as the [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]]. Eccles was reappointed chair in 1936, 1940, and 1944 and served until 1948.&lt;ref name=FRB01/&gt; In February 1944, Roosevelt appointed Eccles for another 14-year term on the board and Eccles stayed on the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve|board]] until 1951, when he resigned over acrimony between the [[Federal Reserve System|Fed]] and the Treasury Department prior to the [[1951 Accord]].&lt;ref name=TR01/&gt; Eccles had also participated in post-[[World War II]] [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] negotiations that created the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. 

Eccles retired to [[Utah]] in 1951 to run his companies and write his memoirs, titled ''Beckoning Frontiers''. He further consolidated industrial and family assets, finally organizing a series of foundations representing assets that he had managed for various family members. These foundations have served Utah and the [[Intermountain West]] in support of educational, artistic, humanitarian, and scientific activities. He died in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] in 1977 and was entombed in the [[Larkin Sunset Lawn Mausoleum]]. 

==Legacy==
Eccles was and is seen as an early proponent of demand stimulus projects to fend off the ravages of the [[Great Depression]]. Eccles was famously rebuked by Congresswoman [[Jessie Sumner]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]], [[Illinois|IL]]) during a House of Representatives hearing on the increasingly liberal policies of the Roosevelt administration and the Federal Reserve, when she said, "''you'' just love socialism".&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Randall Bennett, ''A changing of the guard: Anglo-American relations, 1941-1946'' (The University of North Carolina Press 1990) ISBN 978-0807818770.&lt;/ref&gt; He became known as a defender of [[Keynesian]] ideas, though his ideas predated Keynes' ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]'' (1936). In that respect, he is considered by some to have seen [[monetary policy]] having secondary importance and that as a result he allowed the Federal Reserve to be sublimated to the interests of the Treasury. In this view, the Federal Reserve after 1935 acquired new instruments to command monetary policy, but it did not change its behavior significantly.&lt;ref name=TR01/&gt; Further, his defense of the Federal Reserve-Treasury accord in 1951 is sometimes seen as a reversal of his previous policy stances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The [[Eccles Building]] that houses the headquarters of the [[Federal Reserve]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] was named after Eccles in 1982. The naming was a component of the [[Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act]] lead-sponsored by Senator [[Jake Garn]] (R-[[Utah|UT]]) and Congressman [[Fernand St. Germain]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]], [[Rhode Island|RI]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d097:HR06267:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; |title=Public Law 97-320 |accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eccles was inducted into the [[Junior Achievement]] U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1999.{{fact|date=July 2012}}
