The '''''San Francisco Bay Times''''' is a free weekly [[LGBT]] newspaper in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] that started as ''Coming Up!'' in October 1979. ''Coming Up!'' was billed as "the gay lesbian newspaper and calendar of events for the Bay Area."&lt;ref name="times"&gt;[http://www.laganz.org.nz/serials/cap-cut.html "Lesbian and Gay Archives of New Zealand - Serials Holdings List"] Retrieved on 2007-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=FnGGvT3-NfMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=%22san+francisco+bay+times%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fcqp-8eh0-&amp;sig=4BB5C7rhGxVqUYK9zTbWQuWtfuY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=erAxUIHdFsyBqQH5moCgDQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22san%20francisco%20bay%20times%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, ''Coming Up!'' changed its name to ''San Francisco Bay Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Roland-Schembari-Co-Founder-of-S-F-Bay-Times-2773437.php ''San Francisco Chronicle'' obituary of founder Roland Schembari (February 24, 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, longtime publisher Kim Corsaro stepped down, with Betty Sullivan of LGBT listserve group Betty's List, and her partner Jennifer Viegas, taking over management of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=5910 Cynthia Laird, ''Bay Area Reporter'' (August 4, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;
