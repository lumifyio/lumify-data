'''Code 42 Software Inc.''' is the developer of the CrashPlan [[backup software]] and services suite. It was founded in 2001 as an IT consultancy. Code 42 started a project to create a [[Facebook]]-like desktop application, but ended up focusing on the [[online file storage|online storage]] element, releasing CrashPlan in 2007. The company raised $52.5 million in 2012 as part of a fund by Accel Partners for big data companies.

CrashPlan is sold to consumers on a [[freemium]] model, wherein local backups are free, but uploading to Code 42's servers is sold on a monthly subscription through CrashPlan+. There are also enterprise versions that are usually used to facilitate backups to the company's own servers. CrashPlan gets positive reviews based on its pricing, feature-set and user interface, but large, initial backups are slow.

Code 42 focused on the online storage element of the application,&lt;ref name="minnpost"/&gt; creating CrashPlan in 2007.&lt;ref name="bizjournalsb2b"/&gt;

In June 2011, Code 42 acquired a Minneapolis-based mobile development company, Recursive Awesome LLC, to support its software on mobile devices. Recursive’s employees were moved to its Minneapolis headquarters.&lt;ref name="mbj2011"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ed|last=Stych|newspaper=Minneapolis Business Journal|title=Code 42 buys mobile app firm that works with Best Buy|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/news/2011/06/01/code-42-buys-mobile-app-firm-best-buy.html|date=June 1, 2011|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the company built a 10,000 square-foot expansion to its offices.&lt;ref name="minnpost"/&gt; In 2012, Code 42 raised $52.5 million in funding.&lt;ref name="venturebeatjan2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=McBride|coauthors=Gary Hill|publisher=Reuters|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCATRE80H09T20120118|title=Carbonite rival Code 42 raises $52.5 million|date=January 18, 2012|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mbj2012"&gt;{{cite news|first=Katharine|last=Grayson|newspaper=Minneapolis Business Journal|title=VC investment climbs higher|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/print-edition/2012/04/06/vc-investment-climbs-higher-in-q1-2012.html|date=April 6, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding was the first&lt;ref name="gigaom"/&gt; distribution from a $100 million pool established in 2011 by [[Accel Partners]] to fund Big Data companies.&lt;ref name="venturebeatsept2012"&gt;{{cite news|first=Rebecca|last=Grant|publisher=VentureBeat|title=Origami Logic in process of folding up $8M in funding|date=September 20, 2012|url=http://venturebeat.com/2012/09/20/origami-logic-in-process-of-folding-up-8m-in-funding/|accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==

As of April 2011, 80% of Code 42 Software’s revenue came from business customers, while the remainder comes from consumers&lt;ref name="bizjournalsb2b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="startribune"/&gt; and a small portion from service provider partners.&lt;ref name="crn"/&gt; Code 42 has been profitable each year since it was founded.&lt;ref name="crn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; Code 42 grew from $1.4 million in revenue in 2008 to $11.46 million in 2010 and $18.5 million in 2011.&lt;ref name="incmag"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Inc.
