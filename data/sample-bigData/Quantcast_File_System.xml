'''Quantcast File System''' (QFS) is an open-source [[distributed file system]] software package for large-scale [[MapReduce]] or other batch-processing workloads. It was designed as an alternative to [[Apache Hadoop]]’s [[HDFS]], intended to deliver better performance and cost-efficiency for large-scale processing clusters.

==Design==
QFS is software that runs on a cluster of hundreds or thousands of commodity [[Linux]] servers and allows other software layers to interact with them as if they were one giant hard drive. It has three components:

* A chunk server runs on each machine that will host data, manages I/O to its hard drives, and monitors its activity and capacity.
* A central process called the metaserver keeps the directory structure and maps of files to physical storage. It coordinates activities of all the chunk servers and monitors the overall health of the file system.  For high performance it holds all its data in memory, writing checkpoints and transaction logs to disk for recovery.
* A client component is the interface point that presents a file system API to other layers of the software. It makes requests of the metaserver to identify which chunk servers hold (or will hold) its data, then interacts with the chunk servers directly to read and write.

In a cluster of hundreds or thousands of machines, the odds are low that all will be running and reachable at any given moment, so fault tolerance is the central design challenge. QFS meets it with [[Reed-Solomon error correction]]. The form of Reed-Solomon encoding used in QFS stores redundant data in 9 places and is able to reconstruct the file from any 6 of these stripes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/09/qfs-improves-performance-of-hadoop-file-system.html QFS improves performance of Hadoop file system - Strata]&lt;/ref&gt; When it writes a file, it stripes it across by default nine physically different machines—six holding the data, three holding parity information. Any three of those can become unavailable; if any six remain readable, QFS can reconstruct the original data. The result is fault tolerance at a cost of a 50% expansion of data. 

QFS is written in [[C++ (programming language)|C++]], operates within a fixed memory footprint, and uses direct I/O.

==History==
QFS evolved from the Kosmos File System (KFS), an open source project started by [[Kosmix]] in 2005.  [[Quantcast]] adopted KFS in 2007, built its own improvements on top of it over the next several years, and released QFS 1.0 as an open source project in September, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/data/quantcast-releases-bigger-faster-stronger-hadoop-file-system/ Quantcast releases bigger, faster, stronger Hadoop file system — Tech News and Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;
