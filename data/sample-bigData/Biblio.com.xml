'''Biblio.com''' is the third largest used book marketplace in the US.&lt;ref&gt;BookFinder.com Journal&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2003 in Asheville, NC, Biblio.com has grown to become one of the largest global book marketplaces, with over 50 million books for sale from over 5,000 booksellers in countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Fine Books 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==A used book marketplace==
Begun in 2000 as a [[metasearch engine|metasearch or price comparison engine]], Biblio changed to be a marketplace in February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Biblio seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors by preventing penny books&lt;ref&gt;Sussman&lt;/ref&gt; and limiting print-on-demand books. Biblio recognizes that the bookseller is its customer and encourages communication between the bookseller and the retail bookbuyers.

In May 2009 Biblio launched [http://www.biblio.co.uk/ www.Biblio.co.uk], an e-commerce site dedicated to second hand and antiquarian books in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe.

==Inventory management program==
Biblio.com now provides [http://www.biblio.com/pages/bd_quickstart.html BiblioDirector], an inventory management software that offers one-click uploading to Biblio, but also provides options for uploading to other book marketplace websites as well.

Biblio.com provided Bookhound inventory management program for free to its sellers from June 2008 to December 2012. An updated version of Bookhound is still available for sale through Bibliopolis.

==Speedy searches==
Starting in 2008 Biblio.com launched a complete overhaul of both their site and booksearch technology, based on the [[Solr]] search engine (Solr is a subproject of the [[Apache HTTP Server]] [[Lucene]] project). The Solr search engine provides fast access to 60 million titles by author, title, illustrator, data, and several other fields.  Biblio's stated goal for search is to help customers find their titles in as few clicks as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Biblio 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assisting ABAA and others==
On April 17, 2009 Biblio.com announced  a joint three-way agreement with Bibliopolis, LLC and [[Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America]] (ABAA) to provide a new e-commerce site for ABAA members and their books.&lt;ref&gt;Loftin 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 4-year joint operating agreement, the new ABAA e-commerce site for its book dealers features Biblio.com’s search engine and e-commerce technology. Berkeley-based Bibliopolis was responsible for crafting the design and user interfaces for the site.&lt;ref&gt;Fine Press Book Association&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the ABAA site, Biblio powers similar niche-market sites such as Biblion.co.uk and IOBABooks.com ([[Independent Online Booksellers Association]]).

==The bottom line==
Biblio.com is wholly owned and operated by Biblio, Inc., a privately held company with a commitment to a [[Triple bottom line]], in part through its environmental program, Ecosend, and its work with Biblio Charitable Works, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;PRWeb&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, Biblio announced that it had become the first online book marketplace to offer carbon free shipping through its Ecosend program, purchasing [[carbon offsets]] for the shipment of every book sold through its site.
