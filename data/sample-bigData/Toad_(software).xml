'''T'''ool for '''O'''racle '''A'''pplication '''D'''evelopers (TOAD) is a [[software application]] from [[Dell Software]] used for development and [[database administration|administration]] of various [[relational database]]s using [[SQL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toadsoft.com/ Official Toad site]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supported databases and environments ==
Toad supports the following relational databases: [[Oracle Database]], [[Microsoft SQL Server]], [[Sybase]], [[IBM DB2]], and [[MySQL]]. In 2009, Toad for Cloud Databases was released to offer support for the following non-relational databases: [[Hadoop]], [[mongoDB]], [[SimpleDB]], [[Azure Services Platform]], and [[Apache Cassandra]]. Toad runs on all [[32-bit]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platforms, including [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98|98]], [[Windows NT|NT]], [[Windows 2000|2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]], and [[Windows Vista|Vista]]. For [[backend]] connectivity Toad needs Oracle 32-bit SQL*Net and Oracle version 7.3.4 or later.

Toad can view the [[Oracle data dictionary]] - [[Table (database)|tables]], [[Index (database)|indexes]], [[stored procedure]]s - and do various other tasks through multi-tabbed browsers.

Toad does not support any non-[[Microsoft]] environment. Starting from 2005-02-17, TOra, an [[open source]] [[platform independent]] tool offering some of Toad's basic functionality, is fully maintained by the community.&lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/projects/tora/forums/forum/52736/topic/1130286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/tora/forums/forum/52736/topic/1231653&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell makes Toad available in both commercial and trial/[[freeware]] versions. Freeware is available from the ToadWorld.com community&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toadworld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Jim McDaniel]] (aka "TOADman"), a practicing Oracle developer, originally designed Toad for his own use in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
He called it ''Tool for Oracle Application Developers'': "TOAD" for short. McDaniel made the tool available to others first as [[shareware]] and later as [[freeware]],   distributing it freely over the [[Internet]].

As the user base grew, so did the effort of maintenance and development. Finally, the author realized that he could no longer dedicate substantial amounts of time to the growing quantity of software enhancement requests.

Quest Software, established in 1987, acquired TOAD in October 1998&lt;ref&gt;
