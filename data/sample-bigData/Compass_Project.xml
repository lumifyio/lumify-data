'''Compass''' is a [[free software|free]]/[[open source software|open source]] [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Search algorithm|Search]] Engine Framework built on top of [[Lucene]] created by [[Shay Banon]]. In year 2010 the development was stopped as Shay Banon released [[ElasticSearch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kimchy.org/the_future_of_compass/ Future of Compass]&lt;/ref&gt;

Compass provides a simple API for working with [[Lucene]] (similar to API provided by [[Object-relational mapping|ORM]] libraries). It has built in support for mapping different data "formats" into the search engine such as OSEM - Object to Search Engine Mapping (using annotations or xml), XSEM - XML to Search Engine Mapping (using simple xpath expressions), JSEM - [[JSON]] to Search Engine Mapping and the low level RSEM - Resource to Search Engine Mapping.

Compass integrates with [[Object-relational mapping|ORM]] frameworks allowing for a single API to index all the content mapped by both the ORM and Compass. It also allows to automatically mirror changes done through the ORM API into the Search Engine. Compass has generic support for [[Java Persistence API|JPA]] and embedded support for [[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]], [[OpenJPA]], [[TopLink]], and [[EclipseLink]].

Distributed Lucene index (both pure [[Lucene]] and using Compass) support by allowing to store the Lucene index within Data Grid products such as [http://www.gigaspaces.com GigaSpaces], [http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/coherence/index.html Oracle Coherence Data Grid], and [[Terracotta, Inc.|Terracotta]]. There is also support for distributed and collocated indexing and searching.

Compass provides extensive integration with [[Spring Framework]] including transaction management, Spring MVC, and Spring aspects for reflecting operations to the search engine.
