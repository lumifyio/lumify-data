'''ElasticSearch''' is a distributed, [[Representational state transfer|RESTful]], [[free software|free]]/[[open source software|open source]] search server based on [[Apache Lucene]]. It is developed by Shay Banon&lt;ref name="shaybanon"&gt;[https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/graphs/contributors ElasticSearch Commiters]&lt;/ref&gt; and is released under the terms of the [[Apache License]]. ElasticSearch is developed in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

== History ==

Shay Banon created [[Compass Project|Compass]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="compass"&gt;[http://www.kimchy.org/the_future_of_compass/ The Future of Compass]&lt;/ref&gt; While thinking about the third version of Compass he realized that it would be necessary to rewrite big parts of Compass to "create a scalable search solution".&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt; So he created "a solution built from the ground up to be distributed" and used a common interface, [[JSON]] over [[HTTP]], suitable for programming languages other than Java as well.&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt; Shay Banon released the first version of ElasticSearch in February 2010.&lt;ref name="initversion"&gt;[http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/2010/02/08/youknowforsearch.html Initial version of ElasticSearch]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a French interview some more ideas are explained.&lt;ref name="frenchinterview"&gt;[http://www.touilleur-express.fr/2011/04/12/elasticsearch-interview-with-shay-banon/ French interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

ElasticSearch can be used to search all kinds of documents. It provides a scalable search solution, has near [[real-time search]] and support for [[multitenancy]].&lt;ref name="offizsite"&gt;[http://www.elasticsearch.org/ Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; "ElasticSearch is distributed, which means that indices can be divided into [[shard (database architecture)|shards]] and each shard can have zero or more replicas. Each node hosts one or more shards, and acts as a coordinator to delegate operations to the correct shard(s). Rebalancing and routing are done automatically [...]".&lt;ref name="offizsite"/&gt;

It uses [[Apache Lucene]] and tries to make all features of it available through the [[JSON]] and [[Java API]]. It supports [[Faceted search|facetting]] and [http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/percolate/ percolating], which can be useful for notifying if new documents match for registered queries.

Another feature is called '[[Gateway (computer program)|Gateway]]' and handles the long term persistence of the index&lt;ref name="gateway"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/modules/gateway/ | title=elasticsearch Guide: Gateway | publisher=elasticsearch | accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;- i.e. an index can be recovered from the Gateway in a case of a server crash. ElasticSearch supports real-time [[GET requests]], which makes it suitable as a [[NoSQL]] solution,&lt;ref name="jetslidedatabase"&gt;[http://karussell.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/jetslide-uses-elasticsearch-as-database/ ElasticSearch as database]&lt;/ref&gt; but it lacks [[distributed transactions]].&lt;ref name="transactions"&gt;[http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/Distributed-transaction-support-td951313.html No transaction support]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to other software ==

[[Apache Solr]] is another open source search server built on top of Apache Lucene. [[Sematext]] published a series of posts starting with Solr vs. ElasticSearch Overview&lt;ref name="sematext-solr-vs-es"&gt;[http://blog.sematext.com/2012/08/23/solr-vs-elasticsearch-part-1-overview/ Solr vs. ElasticSearch Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; comparing ElasticSearch v 0.2 vs. Solr (Solr 4.0, aka SolrCloud, more specifically) in a comprehensive and neutral way. Note that the current release of ElasticSearch, 0.9, is now built on Lucene 4.0. In an article from Ryan Sonnek it will be pointed out how Apache Solr and ElasticSearch compare regarding near real-time indexing and searching.&lt;ref name="ryansonnek"&gt;[http://engineering.socialcast.com/2011/05/realtime-search-solr-vs-elasticsearch/ Comparison of Apache Solr and ElasticSearch regarding near real-time indexing]&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the German [[IX (magazine)|iX]] magazine from Peter Karich lists advantages and disadvantages of ElasticSearch &lt;ref name="ix"&gt;[http://www.heise.de/ix/inhalt/2012/03/67/ iX Magazine Article "Immer Flexibel"]&lt;/ref&gt; - an English slide is also available,&lt;ref name="peterkarich"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dc6zhtt5_1frfxwfff&amp;pli=1 Feature comparison of Apache Solr and ElasticSearch]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be summarized as follows:

'''Advantages''':
* ElasticSearch is distributed. No separate project required. Replicas are near real-time too, which is called "Push replication".&lt;ref name="conference1"&gt;[http://vimeo.com/26710663 Video, Berlin Buzz 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conference2"&gt;[http://berlinbuzzwords.de/search/node/elasticsearch Berlin Buzz 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ElasticSearch fully supports the near real-time search of Apache Lucene.
* Handling [[multitenancy]] is not a special configuration, whereas a more advanced setup is necessary with Solr.
* ElasticSearch introduces the concept of the Gateway,&lt;ref name="gateway"/&gt; which makes full backups easier.
 
'''Disadvantages''':
* Only one main developer.&lt;ref name="shaybanon" /&gt; This has to be mitigated since there is now the company ElasticSearch which has a large development team and provides commercial support.

'''Different Usage'''
* Use parent/child feature instead of Solr's results grouping or have a look into [https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/256 this issue] .
* No [[XML]] support, only JSON
* Common container deployment (as a [[WAR (Sun file format)|WAR file]]) is in development [https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-transport-wares plugin]
* No convenient wrapper for [[Java beans]] as the @Field annotation in SolrJ

== Users ==

There are already smaller and some bigger companies using ElasticSearch,&lt;ref name="users"&gt;[http://www.elasticsearch.org/users/ ElasticSearch users]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[StumbleUpon]],&lt;ref name="stumble"&gt;[http://www.stumbleupon.com/blog/dev/searching-for-serendipity/ StumbleUpon uses ElasticSearch]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mozilla]],&lt;ref name="mozilla1"&gt;[http://blog.mozilla.com/data/2010/12/30/flume-hive-and-realtime-indexing-via-elasticsearch-2/ Why Mozilla uses ElasticSearch]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mozilla2"&gt;[http://pedroalves-bi.blogspot.com/2011/03/firefox-4-twitter-and-nosql.html ElasticSearch helps Mozilla Metrics team]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quora]],&lt;ref name="quora"&gt;[http://www.quora.com/Full-Text-Search-on-Quora/What-technology-does-Quora-use-for-its-full-text-search-infrastructure/answer/Adrien-Lucas-Ecoffet Full Text Search on Quora]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foursquare]] &lt;ref name="foursquare"&gt;[http://engineering.foursquare.com/2012/08/09/foursquare-now-uses-elastic-search-and-on-a-related-note-slashem-also-works-with-elastic-search/ foursquare now uses Elastic Search]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Etsy]],&lt;ref name="etsy"&gt;[https://github.com/etsy/oculus#installation-overview Oculus: The metric correlation component of Etsy's Kale system]&lt;/ref&gt; [[SoundCloud]],&lt;ref name="soundcloud"&gt;[http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2012/12/architecture-behind-our-new-search-and-explore-experience/ Architecture behind our new Search and Explore experience]&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[GitHub]].&lt;ref name="github"&gt;[https://github.com/blog/1381-a-whole-new-code-search A Whole New Code Search]&lt;/ref&gt;
