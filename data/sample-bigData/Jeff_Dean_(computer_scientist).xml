'''Jeff Dean''' is an American [[computer scientist]] and [[software engineer]]. He is currently a Google Fellow in the Systems and Infrastructure Group.

== Personal life and education ==
Jeff Dean received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [[University of Washington]], working with Craig Chambers on whole-program optimization techniques for object-oriented languages. He received a B.S., summa cum laude from the [[University of Minnesota]] in Computer Science &amp; Economics in 1990. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2009, which recognized his work on "the science and engineering of large-scale distributed computer systems."

== Career in computer science ==
Prior to joining [[Google]], he was at [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]/[[Compaq]]'s Western Research Laboratory, where he worked on profiling tools, microprocessor architecture, and information retrieval. 

Prior to graduate school, he worked at the [[World Health Organization]]'s Global Programme on [[AIDS]], developing software for statistical modeling and forecasting of the [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] [[pandemic]].

==Career at Google==
Jeff Dean joined Google in mid-1999, and is currently a Google Fellow in the Systems Infrastructure Group. While at Google, he has designed and implemented large portions of the company's advertising, crawling, indexing and query serving systems, along with various pieces of the distributed computing infrastructure that sits underneath most of Google's products. At various times, he has also worked on improving search quality, statistical machine translation, and various internal software development tools and has had significant involvement in the engineering hiring process. 

Among others, the projects he's worked on include:

* [[Spanner (distributed database technology)|Spanner]] - a scalable, multi-version, globally-distributed, and synchronously-replicated database
* Some of the production system design and statistical machine translation system for [[Google Translate]].
* [[BigTable]], a large-scale semi-structured storage system.
* [[MapReduce]] a system for large-scale data processing applications.
* [[Google Brain]] a system for large-scale artificial neural networks

== Awards and honors ==
* Elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]] (2009)
* Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (2009)
*[http://awards.acm.org/infosys/ ACM-Infosys Foundation Award](2012)
