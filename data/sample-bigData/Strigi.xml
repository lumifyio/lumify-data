'''Strigi''' is a [[desktop search]] [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]], which is [[operating system]]-independent and [[desktop environment|desktop]]-independent. Strigi was initiated by [[Jos van den Oever]]. Strigi's goals are to be fast, use a small amount of [[Random access memory|RAM]], and use flexible [[backend]]s and [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s.&lt;ref name=sourceforge&gt;[http://strigi.sourceforge.net/?q=features Strigi's features]&lt;/ref&gt; A benchmark as of January 2007 showed that Strigi is faster and uses less memory than other search systems,&lt;ref name=KDEdev&gt;[http://kdedevelopers.org/node/2639 Benchmark between Beagle, JIndex, Tracker and Strigi] 01-17-2007&lt;/ref&gt; but it lacks many of their features{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.  Like most desktop search systems, Strigi can extract information from files, such as the length of an audio clip, the contents of a document, or the resolution of a picture; plugins determine what filetypes it is capable of handling.&lt;ref name=Ldotcom&gt;http://www.linux.com/feature/126312&lt;/ref&gt; Strigi uses its own Jstream system which allows for [[deep indexing]] of files. Strigi is accessible via [[Konqueror]], or by clicking on its [[icon (computing)|icon]], after adding it to [[KDE]]'s [[Kicker (KDE)|Kicker]] or [[GNOME Panel]]. (In [[GNOME]] desktop, it is called the [[OpenTracker|Deskbar]] applet.) The [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) is named Strigiclient.&lt;ref name=Ldotcom/&gt;

==Features==
* [[SHA-1]] hash for every file indexed to find duplicates
* As of July, 2007 Strigi supports indexing the contents of [[plain text]], [[PDF]], [[MP3]], archives, [[Debian]] and [[RPM]] packages, and OASIS [[OpenDocument]] text (odt), spreadsheet (ods) and presentation (odp) files
* [[D-Bus]] and socket support for communication between the daemon and search program
* Small memory footprint
* [[Xesam]] query language support
* Very portable, currently runs on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=Strigi&amp;stype=all&lt;/ref&gt; Mac OS X and Windows
* Pluggable backend: [[Lucene]] and [[HyperEstraier]], [[SQLite]] and [[Xapian]] backends are being worked on
* [[inotify]] and synchronization to filesystem are being attempted.&lt;ref name="sourceforge" /&gt;
* Strigi's indexing can be stopped manually, and will suspend itself if running on a laptop's batteries, disk drive runs out of space,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/3573&lt;/ref&gt; and/or runs in the background until the [[CPU]] is not busy with tasks that the computer-user is waiting on the CPU for.&lt;ref name="KDEdev" /&gt;

==Operating systems and desktops==
[[KDE Plasma Workspaces]] require Strigi as core component of the new [[semantic desktop]] technologies.
Strigi and [[NEPOMUK (framework)|NEPOMUK]] are working together to help create a [[semantic desktop]] search. NEPOMUK will allow the user to add metadata, which Strigi will be able to index for a more precise search. Developers are also considering adding [[Sonnet (KDE)|Sonnet]] support to Strigi to allow users to search for documents written in a specific language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux.com/articles/59963 Linux.com: KDE 4's Sonnet will turbocharge language processing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GNOME]] has an optional applet to search for files using Strigi, named Deskbar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://packages.debian.org/unstable/gnome/deskbar-plugins-strigi Debian - Details of package deskbar-plugins-strigi in sid&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Deskbar is included in the GNOME desktop of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 8.10, for example.
