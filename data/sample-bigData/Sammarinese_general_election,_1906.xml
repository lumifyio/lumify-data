A '''general election''' was held in [[San Marino]] on 10 June 1906.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1678 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first-ever election in the country, after that the [[Sammarinese Citizenry Meeting, 1906|Citizenry Meeting]] had restored [[democracy]] three months before. 

== Electoral law ==
The [[electoral law]] to select the '''1st term''' of the [[Grand and General Council]] was acted on May 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consigliograndeegenerale.sm/on-line/home/archivio-leggi-decreti-e-regolamenti.html?P0_path=%2Fhome%2Ftomcat%2Findicizzazione%2Findexleggi&amp;P0_paginazione=15&amp;P0_pagina=1&amp;P0_orderBy=index_lucene%2Cdata_ordered%2Cnumero&amp;P0_order=asc%2Cdesc%2Cdesc&amp;P0_operatorMustBe=yes&amp;P0_title=&amp;P0_tipo=&amp;P0_numero=&amp;P0_anno=1906&amp;annoiniziale=&amp;annofinale=&amp;P0_data_gg=&amp;P0_data_mm=&amp;P0_data_aa=&amp;P0_document=&amp;P0_data_ordered=&amp;indicericerca=-1&amp;x=20&amp;y=13 Grand and General Council database. (it.) ]&lt;/ref&gt; All [[householder]]s and [[graduate]]s over 25 years of age could vote. The republic was divided in nine multi-member constituencies according their population:
*[[City of San Marino]] 22 seats,
*[[Serravalle]] 12 seats,
*[[Faetano]] 6 seats,
*[[Montegiardino]] 4 seats,
*[[Chiesanuova]] 4 seats,
*[[Acquaviva]] 4 seats,
*[[Domagnano]] 4 seats,
*[[Fiorentino]] 2 seats,
*[[San Giovanni]] 2 seats.
All councillors were elected in their constituency using a [[plurality-at-large voting]], a [[non-partisan]] system. However, candidates elected belonged to the [[Liberalism|liberal]] group which had supported the democratic action of the [[Sammarinese Citizenry Meeting, 1906|Citizenry Meeting]] or, more, were members of the sole organized party of the country, the [[Sammarinese Socialist Party]], which claimed to have won 29 seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psd.sm/area/altri/enti/democratici/doc/doc100/nuovo_titano%20B%20.pdf Party of Socialist and Democrats of San Marino (it.) ]&lt;/ref&gt; These two great factions formed together the first democratic government of the country.
