:''The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;'''Please do not modify it.'''&lt;/span&gt;  Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's [[Help:Using talk pages|talk page]] or in a [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|deletion review]]).

&lt;!--Template:Afd top

Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links in order to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. --&gt;

The result was '''Keep''' as per unanimous positive consensus and the absence of calls for deletion outside of the nominator. A non-admin closure. [[User:And Adoil Descended|And Adoil Descended]] ([[User talk:And Adoil Descended|talk]]) 00:54, 1 August 2012 (UTC)

:({{Find sources|Big data}})
Recreation of deleted article, with the same problems as identified in that AfD; not a well defined concept (as the first line states); not well sourced (relying on many blogs and wikis, or on articles that are on data that is big but not data as a concept); articles already exist for actual techniques and technologies for large datasets. &lt;small&gt;[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;"&gt;[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]&lt;/sub&gt; 20:22, 25 July 2012 (UTC)
* '''comment''' I see this is actually the third nomination; a second intermediate one resulted in a keep. Even reviewing that it still seems to be a loosely defined and poorly sourced term, used occasionally in different contexts but not a concept in its own right.--&lt;small&gt;[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;"&gt;[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]&lt;/sub&gt; 20:29, 25 July 2012 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' It may not be a well defined concept, but that hasn't kept it from being heavily discussed in [[WP:RS]]. From the first page of Google hits alone you have discussions from [[IBM]], [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], and ''[[Forbes]]''. I'm not surprised that it was deleted in 2009, but the second nomination was a pretty clear keep over two years ago, and the idea has only become bigger since. It was also a [http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2685/4461757843_7869b5d691.jpg cover story] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', one of over 8000 Google Scholar hits. References already in the article include ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''. It's a bit of a buzzword (buzzphrase?) these days, so I'm sympathetic if you want it to go away, but this isn't the way it will happen. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 22:23, 25 July 2012 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' poor sourcing and even poor article quality is not a valid reason for deletion. Concept is notable. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 03:57, 26 July 2012 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - This topic has received significant coverage in reliable sources. Some examples include, but are not limited to: [http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/mar/09/big-data-theory], [http://www.economist.com/node/15557443?story_id=15557443], [http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_visualizing##ixzz0llT2DN5j], [http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/start-up-goes-after-big-data-with-hadoop-helper/?dbk]. &lt;small&gt;&lt;font face="arial"&gt;[[User:Northamerica1000|Northamerica1000]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 08:26, 27 July 2012 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - What a bizarre nomination. This term survived two deletion attempts by many of these same editors. When does this become an edit war? The only thing that has changed since then is
::1) improved quality
::2) term is now '''undeniably''' mainstream
:Could it be that the nominators and strong deletes are British and this term is used more in the US? [[User:Jeremykemp|jk]] ([[User talk:Jeremykemp|talk]]) 16:49, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
::'''comment''': it ''didn't'' survive the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Big data|first AfD]], quite the opposite. It was recreated and survived the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Big data (2nd nomination)|second]].--&lt;small&gt;[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;"&gt;[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]&lt;/sub&gt; 17:44, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
:::'''reply''': Indeed - I restarted it. Back then I spent some intense effort over several days. but now I don't think this term needs much support. Honestly - I'm just very puzzled here. I know JohnB is a dedicated editor - and lives in the UK. So I've got a strong hunch here that this term is an Americanism...?

* '''Keep''' – The [[Pointy-haired Boss]] in this weekend's [[Dilbert]] has quoted the ''Book of Wikipedia'' when talking about Big Data. If that doesn't establish notability, then nothing is notable. &lt;s&gt;(Reference is made to a previously deleted article -- how can we look at that article IOT compare deficiencies, etc.?)&lt;s&gt; --[[User:Srich32977|S. Rich]] ([[User talk:Srich32977|talk]]) 17:37, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - I picked this up from another entry, and found it useful in realatively simple terms.  It does not get lost in detail which is helpful for anyone like me new to the topic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class="autosigned"&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Meiselsgerry|Meiselsgerry]] ([[User talk:Meiselsgerry|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Meiselsgerry|contribs]]) 19:52, 31 July 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
