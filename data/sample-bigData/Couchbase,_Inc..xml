==History==
Couchbase Inc. was created through the merger of Membase Inc. and CouchOne Inc. in 2011.  Membase Inc. was founded in 2009 and developed and provided commercial packages and support for the Couchbase Server open source project, a NoSQL key-value database that leverages [[memcached]] technology.  CouchOne Inc. was also founded in 2009 and developed and provided commercial support for the Apache [[CouchDB]] open source project, a NoSQL document database.  The merged company aimed to combine the strengths of Membase (and Memcached) as well as Apache CouchDB to build a easily scalable, high-performance document-oriented NoSQL database.

==Couchbase Open Source Project==
[[Couchbase Server|Couchbase]] is an open source NoSQL database that can be used as either a document-oriented or pure key-value database and is supported by Couchbase Inc. and licensed under the [[Apache 2.0 licensing|Apache 2.0 license]]. It aims for easy scalability, consistent high performance, high reliability and ease of development. When used as a document-oriented database,  data is stored in [[JSON]] format which can be indexed and queried. 

While Couchbase took inspiration from Apache CouchDB and memcached, it is a completely different and separate open source project.  It has a separate and independent community, provides a very different set of capabilities, and supports very different use cases.  More specifically, Couchbase leveraged and modified memcached technology to provide built-in caching and leveraged and modified Apache CouchDB technology to enable the document capabilities in recent releases of Couchbase.  Couchbase open source project,&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/couchbase&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/couchbaselabs&lt;/ref&gt; development is based around [[Github]] source-control  and the community is encouraged to contribute to the open source project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.couchbase.com/wiki/display/couchbase/Contributing+Changes&lt;/ref&gt;

Couchbase is used at several companies including [[Zynga]] and [[SHFL entertainment|Shufflemaster]] for gaming, [[AOL]] and [[DG (company)|MediaMind]]  for ad platforms, [[Salesforce.com]] and [[Concur]] for SaaS business applications, [[Orbitz]] and [[Sabre Holdings|Sabre]] for e-commerce, and [[Thomson Reuters]] and [[McGraw-Hill]] for online media.
