Nikki S.Lee is a Korean-born, New York City based artist, photographer, and filmmaker. Her most notable works, Projects, documents her socialization with various American and immigrant subcultures. These socialization projects, photographed by Lee's friends or passing strangers and exhibited as snapshots, have been the subject of widely divergent interpretations and critiques. More recent works include a series called Parts, which the artist arranges photographs of herself in couple shots while her partner is obscured. Most recently, the artist has undertaken a documentary wherein one of her manifestations of her self documents the daily life of another manifestation of her self.

== [[White Bear, Saskatchewan]] ==

White Bear, Saskatchewan is a small hamlet located approximately 55 miles northwest of [[Swift Current]], SK on the north side of the South Saskatchewan River.  Its name comes from the sighting of a probable but now extirpated white prairie grizzly bear[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bear] by an [[Assiniboine]] warrior on the shores of a neighboring lake during the [[Palliser Expedition]] of the 1850’s.  Records from early Metis settlers and the [[NWMP]] state the last roaming herd of [[American buffalo]] being slaughtered in the hills of the Missouri Coteau located 25 miles northeast around 1879.

During the 1930’s White Bear was a bustling community of approximately 250 residents with two grocery stores, a school, four elevators and three garages servicing an area of 200 families, but has since dwindled to a population of 13 in 2006.  Part of the death is attributed to federal policy changes regarding agriculture, the routing of the No. 4 Highway through the neighboring town of Kyle, and the later abandonment of the CN Rail line in that area of Saskatchewan.  It is interesting to note that the region rarely suffered poor crops, except during the droughts of the [[Great Depression]] and 1988.  It is connected to the rest of the province through Highway 342, albeit a now-decrepit road featuring signs with Imperial units in portions.  Farmers from the area played prominently in the socialism that would later define Saskatchewan then Canada through the introduction of Medicare [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_%28Canada%29] and state-ran insurance[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_Government_Insurance].  The White Bear Hotel remains the only business in operation, noted for its hot wings and hospitality.

A fargot is an insult directed at an individual. It is a combination of the words Fart and Faggot. A young lad named Evan Mumma created this brilliant word when he was only 13. Prodigy i know! There is no simple definition of fargot. Some say it means Stinky faggot. Others say it means a farting homosexual. Whatever it means, it sure is a cool word.

'''BIOGRAPHY:'''

Music lover and Entertainer: Mike Katz / DJ Vertx was turned onto the party circuit while it was in its largest movement - the late nineties. He first started organizing and hosting rave-themed events in mid 2001, starting off with a fully versatile line up, and eventually focused his interest and time on more particular styles, splitting his love of music between two separate themes. One being the ever-growing Drum-n-Bass and Heavy-Jungle oriented genres with their addictive rolling baselines, anthems, and dark fast paced styles. The second and more commonly played tunes contain a full collection of all forms of Hip-Hop spiced with some Dance-Hall and Reggae. Vertx gradually found himself often manipulating all of the above forms of music together and taught himself how to read a crowd in order to build a vibe that left people always wanting to come back and hear more. Through much admiration and respect for the scene and those in it Vertx continues hosting and playing events on a regular basis, focusing not only on the New York Metro areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island, but is currently touring the country sponsored by Captain Morgan liquor.

Previously featured on Demostreams.com (now defunct), the founder of UNDERSTANDINC (NYC) NO DRAMA STATESIDE and NO DRAMA WORLDWIDE as well as 1LEVELUP Marketing, Vertx has been sponsored by BEWILD.com along with SOBE ADRENALINE energy drinks and most currently Captain Morgan’s.

Someone who know Wikipedia better than I, please help me make this the best artical that it can be. ok, here goes......


Charles Guy is from Champagne, south of Chicago. He was my best friend for years. While a student in Chicago he was a DJ at a local radio station, perhaps the college's radio station. Charles loved wierd music that was mostly things like electronic noise, feedback, and smashing things like TVs on stage. 

Before Charles and I met he had worked for BAO (Bruce Arwick Organization, not 100% sure of the spelling). Later he was at Microsoft, when He and Tony Zander created the bulk of what became MS Space Simulator. Charles told me that Zander was the greates game artist he'd ever worked with. (I guess Zander could use an artical as well. Zander was still at MS at least until 2002) 

Charles went to school or worked with Eric Albers and Chris Green, the founders of Leaping Lizard software in Gaithersburg, MD. About 1/2 hour outside of Washington DC. 

When I joined Leaping Lizard Charles and Chris and Eric were already programming a computer game Called Warhammer 40,000: Dark Crusaders. The company was very small, and office space was limited so  Charles and I shared an office togther. 

A few years later Charles came to work at Zombie VR studios in Seattle, where I was already working. We helped make Spec-Ops: Rangers lead the way. At Zombie Charles programed the engine that allowed us to make the first commerically available 3D VR forest. 

After Zombie Charles did a few really neat things, and eventually went to work in California maintaining and improving the servers for the Everquest online Game. 

About 5 years ago he got cancer and died. and I really really miss him. He was that kind of guy (another pun) who you woould ask any kind of question and he'd be able to answer you. He taught me my love of astronomy. 

He had a cat named Smudge.  





a note about Leaping Lizard, people who worked at LL went on to do some very cool things, and the owners had already made some famous titles. Here's a short list of LL people and their games. 

Chris Green: The Elder Scrolls: Arena  made by Bethesdia Software
Eric Albers: Made Simfarm singlehandedly for Maxis. 

Bernie, who got his first job at LL went on to work on Halo: Combat Evolved for Microsoft, and Spec-Ops: Rangers Lead the way for Zombie VR Studios. (Bernie and I actually worked together at LL, Zombie, and at Microsoft's Bungie. 

Missy Castro made games for LL and Sierra

Spawn of Kyuss are a [[fictional]] breed of [[undead]] from the [[role-playing game]] [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]. As their name suggests, they are heavily associated with the [[Greyhawk]] diety Kyuss. Spawn of Kyuss are intelligent and free-willed undead, though they are obsessed with accomplishing the goals of their creator-god Kyuss, primarily through spreading corruption.

In appearance, Spawn of Kyuss closely resemble zombies, though they are differentiated by the multitude of bilious green worms that infest their dead flesh. These worms are particularly prone to slithering out of the Spawn's mouth and eye-sockets. These worms posses a strange symbiotic link with their undead host; the worms perish after several minutes if seperated from their host.

The sole exceptions are if the worm is stored in a potion of Quiet Repose or brought into contact with living flesh, whereupon it instantly begins burrowing through flesh and bone to reach the nervous system and, from there, the brain. Devouring the victim's brain transforms the victim into a new Spawn of Kyuss. The symbiotic link is not one way though; a Spawn somehow seperated from its swarming worms also perishes rapidly.

Spawn of Kyuss posses extremely potent auras of magical fear, and are made equally fearsome in combat due to their ability to both attempt to infest their opponents with worms of Kyuss, turning them into new Spawn, and their ability to regenerate damage.

Spawn of Kyuss and their master Kyuss have featured heavily in recent issues of [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]] and [[Dungeon Magazine]] due to the publishing of the "Age of Worms" adventure path. Dragon Magazine #336 features an article on the Ecology of the Spawn of the Kyuss, which not only discusses the Spawn but also features a template for Favoured Spawn of Kyuss as well as an updated Divine Profile for Kyuss himself.

As of Dragon Magazine #336, this has been Kyuss's official profile. Kyuss's clasical manifestation is a guant man with empty eye sockets filled with writhing green worms and with hands of bare bone. His new manifestation is reported as a humanoid-shaped mass of writhing green worms. Kyuss is a Demigod of Neutral Evil alignment.

Symbol: a human skull with green worms in the mouth and eye sockets.

Portfolio: creation and control of the undead, decay, unholy transformation of the flesh, worms

Domains: Death, Destruction, Evil (Games Masters using the Book of Vile Darkness accessory can also add Corruption to this list)

Favoured Weapon: Club

Clerical Training: new cultists must undergo a ritual known as First Ingestion to prove their loyalty, which consists of drinking a potion of Inflict Light Wounds that contains a preserved Worm of Kyuss.

Quests: luring powerful individuals into the worship of Kyuss and deceiving members of other faiths so they serve Kyuss's goals are most commong.

Prayers: Kyuss's servants pray to him once a month in a ritual that involves the consumption of live worms.

Temples: in remote locations far from civilisation, vast subterranian temples and tabernacles are dedicated to Kyuss.

Rites: Kyuss's servants prepare for his return, the legendary Age of the Worms, and undertake a variety of goals to achieve this end.

Herald and Allies: Kyuss's Herald is an Red Dracolich named Dragotha, and his most common reponse to Planar Ally spells are demons with the Favoured Spawn of Kyuss template.

The Sentence: Six Basic Patterns Built On Verb Types
Basic sentence patterns are built around verbs. There are six different verb types that are followed by structures always associated with those verbs. Therefore, there are six basic sentence patterns, which are also called sentence nuclei. Once these basic patterns are understood, other structures may be attached to the sentence nuclei to form larger sentences. These other structures added to the sentence nuclei are usually phrases or clauses that function as nouns, verbs, adjective and adverbs. 

1. The first verb type is called "intransitive." This type of verb can end the sentence, or it can be followed by an adverb phrase. Intransitive verbs do not need to be followed by noun phrases or adjective phrases.

1a. The president spoke.

1b. Margo slept.

1c. Margo slept soundly.

1d. The small boy jumped from the high oak tree.

1e. Jimmy went to London.

2. The second verb type is called "linking." This type of verb must be followed by noun phrases or adjective phrases, which refer to the same person or thing as the subject of the sentence. Some typical linking verbs are become, appear, grow, remain, stay, and seem. Some other linking verbs involving the senses are feel, look, smell, sound, and taste. Note that the forms of the verb "be" are placed in a special category below, because forms of "be," unlike other linking verbs, can be followed immediately by an "adverb of place."

2a. Clark Kent became Superman.

2b. The president looked weary.

2c. Jamal remained an honest man.

3. The third verb type is the word "be" and all its forms, which is a special category of linking verb. The verb "be," unlike other linking verbs, can be followed by a phrase functioning as an "adverb of place," in addition to the noun phrases or adjective phrases that follow other types of linking verbs. The word "be" has eight forms: be, is, am, are, was, were, been, being.

3a. The student is a math whiz.

3b. Marilyn was insecure.

3c. The new houses are around the corner. (The verb is followed by a phrase functioning as an adverb of place.)

4. The fourth verb type is "one-place transitive." This verb must be followed by a noun phrase that functions as a direct object. Often the subject "does something" to this object. Sentences with transitive verbs can usually be turned into passive sentences. Note that some intransitive verbs can also be used as transitive verbs.

4a. The office manager typed the letter.

4b. Satellites monitor the country's military bases.

4c. The country's military bases are monitored by satellites. (Sentence 4b is changed to a passive sentence.)

5. The fifth verb type is "Vg two-place transitive." This "Vg" verb can be followed by one of two structures. In the first pattern, the verb is followed by two noun phrases, with the first noun phrase functioning as an indirect object, and the second functioning as a direct object. The alternate sentence pattern is related to the first, but the first noun phrase is a direct object, and the second is an indirect object placed in a prepositional phrase introduced by "to" or "for," or more rarely by "of." Sentences formed from "Vg" verbs must always have both direct and indirect objects. Although indirect objects are usually living things, they can also be inanimate objects.

5a. Dennis bought Ann some fancy flowers.

5b. Scientists fed some nutritious food to the laboratory rats.

5c. The Governor gave the schools additional money.

5d. The senator asked a question of the Supreme Court Justice.

6. The sixth verb type is "Vc two-place transitive." This "Vc" verb is followed by a noun phrase that functions as a direct object, plus another noun phrase, adjective phrase, or infinitive phrase that functions as a complement. The term "complement" refers to a structure that completes a phrase or clause.

6a. Republicans consider Democrats big spenders.

6b. Excessive tax cuts make some people uncomfortable.

6c. Some historians believe Franklin Roosevelt to be our most effective president.

Baggy trousers worn by sailors of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  This word was a fanciful corruption of French garguesque, "in the Greek style," hinting at their place of origin.  Galligaskins were not always spoken of directly in polite conversation.  The first recorded substitute for them was inexpressibles in 1790, which suited Victorian taste so well that a rash of euphemisms emerged in the 1830s and 1840s, including unmentionables, inexplicables, unutterables, and the superlative unwhisperables.

Sexual deviations like acrotomophilia (amelotasis), apotemnophilia, abasiophilia, teratophilia and the desire for partners with other disabilities.

Resume

An overview of disability paraphilias. Terms: devotees (disability paraphiliacs), pretenders (ones pretending they have disabilities), wannabes (ones desiring to become disabled). Keywords: acrotomophilia, amelotasis, amputation, amputee(s), apotemnophilia, BIID (Body Integrity Identity Disorder), body dysmoprphia, devotees, disability devotees, disability fetishism, disability wannabes, disability pretenders, fetish, fetishism, pretenders, wannabes.

History

Allusions to the attraction are found in Herodotus, works by Breugel the Elder, Michel de Montaigne, Pushkin, Bulgakov, Dali, Brecht, von Stroheim, Bunuel and James Dean. It has become better known since the late 19th Century and the 1960s’ Sexual Revolution. A community of disability devotees is emerging in the internet.

Nature

Devotees desire sexual partners with disabilities, mostly amputations. An invisible pale desires partners with developmental and intellectual disabilities.

Over half of all devotees feel the attraction since childhood. Some cannot attribute its emergence to a specific occasion. Others cherish memories of objects of their future attention. About a quarter of devotees discover the attraction in puberty, and some do so after sexual maturity.

Each devotee has strictly defined preferences. Thus, most acrotomophiles feel weak desire or no desire for partners with other disabilities. There are plentiful additional definitions for each devotee on matters such as whether the disability was acquired or congenital, et c.

The desire to acquire a disability may be viewed as a peculiar variation of the attraction. Called wannabes, those who experience it suffer from Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID) or body dysmorphia (apotemnophilia if they desire to become amputees) and appear to number not more than one in 20 of all devotees. 

That wannabeism is a logical extension of devoteeism is an assumption. The similarities and differences between devotees and wannabes are hotly debated in the devotee community.

Population

By mid-2006, the virtual world devotee community comprised some 100,000 members of dedicated internet fora. The uneven distribution of internet, the passivity of most members of each community, and the probable ‘grey zone’ of those who belong to the community only partially may bear out assumptions that there are about a third of a million devotees worldwide. 

There are indications that while in most countries there is one or fewer devotees per million population, in First World nations the incidence rises to about 100 devotees per million.

By sex over nine in every ten devotees are male, yet the subculture does contain female devotees. By sexual orientation, the share of homosexual and bisexual devotees appears identical to that in the general population.

An appropriate glance at the population of people with disabilities shows them as predominantly elderly: up to 80 per cent of them are over the retirement age. According to different data and thresholds, disabled people form up to a tenth of the population. Delving further, amputees are not more than one per cent of disabled people, and over 80 per cent of them are men. Leg amputations predominate at almost 80 per cent of this total, with above-knee ones accounting for under 20 per cent of the subtotal.

Behaviour

For devotees, a disability does not reduce a potential partner’s attractiveness but significantly boosts it. No cases are known in which a devotee has physically harmed a partner with a disability or caused disability to an able-bodied partner. Wannabes regularly engage in self-harm, often with fatal outcomes.

It appears that a fair number of devotees succeed in establishing the relationships they desire. It is often claimed that such relationships are ordinary, the attraction being sated by the mere presence of a disability. There appear, however, to be certain peculiarities in such relationships. Successful devotees often go through a series of relationships: something explained by the fact that sexual satiety may not necessarily satisfy broader emotional needs (similar patterns exist among other sexual minorities such as some gay men). Also, devotees may press their disabled partners to put their disabilities to the forefront in intimate situations and exhibit them in social ones.

Over half of all devotees fail to establish their desired relationships. Those who have not become aware of themselves as devotees often harbour guilty thoughts and feel themselves to be unique. Over the past decade, a number of devotees have opened websites with images of their ideal partners (often retouched photographs of able bodied people). Other sites carry descriptions of fictional encounters between devotees and desired partners, drawings of such partners, and devotee pornography (often produced in cooperation with disabled people).

Many devotees direct their desires into creative pursuits. Ukrainian theatre director Andriy Zholdak produces plays with amputees, British sculptor Mark Quinn displays statues of amputees on Trafalgar Square in London, art photographers Gerhard Aba, Eric Croll and Yuriy Solomenko photograph amputees, directors produce films like Crime Delicado and Boxing Helena with amputees, balletomanes produce dance shows with amputees.

Some devotees collect personal data about desired persons, follow and photograph them candidly, engineer seemingly spontaneous meetings with them, call them by telephone, and seek them out in healthcare establishments and civic gatherings of disabled people. An unknown number of devotees hold jobs providing contact with disabled people. Others are members of societies, sporting clubs, et c., of people with disabilities. Collecting objects linked with disability is a pastime for some devotees.
Pretending is another expression of the paraphilia. Some devotees derive sexual pleasure by pretending to have a disability. Others persuade partners to pretend. Pretending usually takes place in privacy or intimacy, but may occasionally be practiced in public. There have been complaints that, in dedicated devotee chatrooms, male devotees en masse pretend to be women with disabilities; if true, this would suggest the broadest aptitude to pretending among devotees. The putative continuum between non-pretending devotees, pretenders, and wannabes has not been researched.

Online, devotees exchange descriptions of sightings of disabled people, experiences of meetings with them, biographies of famous people with disabilities, techniques for attracting their attention, and opinions on acceptable/unacceptable devotee behaviour. There are attempts to condemn the objectification of disabled people. Wannabe fora are dominated by enquiries as to which doctors may be willing to perform elective amputations of healthy limbs.

The devotee community has a growing English-based internal terminology which emerged in the 1930s. The word ‘devotee,’ adopted in the early 1980s due to its alliteration with ‘amputee’ is entering research usage.

Explanations

The attraction is rarely visited by scientific literature and has not been subjected to rigorous research. While depriving interested parties of information, this suggests that devotees have not caused concern among disabled people and the public. In contrast, there is much interest and many publications on the much smaller number of wannabes, indicating significant public concern. Some explanations are at odds with each other, yet a number are repeated by all relevant sides.

Psychiatric

Psychiatry ranks devotees alongside sadomasochistic fetishists, though aside from their mainstream:

1.	Devotees are suppressed homosexuals. This first explanation (by Krafft-Ebbing in his 1872 Psychopathia Sexualis) rests on the assumption that amputation stumps resemble phalli and is in line with the contemporaneous linking of sexual oddity with homosexuality;

2.	Devotees are sadists who consider disabled people as having a lower status, from which they derive satisfaction;

3.	Devotees are masochists who seek self-denigration by associating with disabled partners;

4.	Devotees are voyeurs intrigued by the unusual behaviour and appearance of disabled people;

5.	Wannabes are exhibitionists seeking satisfaction in the reaction of other people; 

As regards points 2 to 5 above, psychology views sadism and masochism as interchangeable, with voyeurism and exhibitionism as their respective aspects. Devotees’ preference for exhibitionist-minded partners would seem to support these explanations. Further explanations include:

6.	Teratophilia: the desire for deformed partners;

7.	Classical fetishism: shifting the focus of desire from a person to objects. Here, it could be expected that crutches and other disability aids would feature among devotees’ sexual foci, and they do indeed feature in devotee websites;

8.	Coprophilia: the fetish for excreta; since amputation stumps may be interpreted as resembling stools, devotees are assumed to be coprophiliacs.

   Sexological

Sexologists do not consider the paraphilia a deviation unless exercising it infringes the rights of one of the parties and/or those of third parties. Explanations include:

1.	Imprinting: the impact of influential events on sexual behaviour. Meeting visibly traumatised people awakes strong emotions. In children, they could give rise to quasi-logical reasoning and a desire for people with the type of trauma encountered.

2.	Implied parental approval: if, when encountering a disabled person, a future devotee’s parents express admiration, infantile logic may conclude that disability is admirable, later ranking it among sexual preferences;

3.	Flight from pressure: strict parenting requirements for good behaviour and academic or sporting achievements may cause the future devotee to seek respite in sickness and disability. With time, the desire to become disabled is ‘projected’ onto others. 
The analogy with the Munchhausen Syndrome (self-inducing illness as a way to obtain compassion and benefits) in 11 above is plain in wannabes, where projection has failed, leaving them to see themselves as more attractive with a disability. The fact that most devotees feel the attraction from childhood also backs the above explanations.

4.	Transvestism and transsexuality are put forward as explanations for pretenders and wannabes.

5.	The “Mars-Venus” explanation put forward by Anne Hooper (“The Amputee Fetish,” Forum, Penthouse Publications, London, June 1978) states that all men see all women as ‘amputees’ and vice-versa, the physical difference aiding attraction. Devoteeism could be regarded as a version of this;

6.	“Darwinian Theory”: devotees see disabled partners as proven in natural selection, having already cheated death.

   Of Devotees

The devotee community constantly debates the origins of the paraphilia. The Amelotatist: A Statistical Profile (Ampix [ex.], Lawndale, California, 1979), a survey setting out the results of a poll among some 400 devotees is an internal contribution and the first synthesis of many explanations. Current internal community explanations include:

1.	Devoteeism as an unusual variant of physical criteria which everyone has for potential partners;

2.	Disabled people perform a number of actions in original ways which capture onlookers the same way a ballerina captures audiences;

3.	Devoteeism as extreme curiosity; everyone is curious about the appearance, sensation and residual functions of bodies affected by disability;

4.	Devoteeism is a sexualised extension of normal human compassion;

5.	It is possible that each devotee became one for a variety of personal motivations rarely replicated in other cases;

6.	Devoteeism is not sexual as such, since it is often felt prior to puberty. 
As regards 6 above, the Freudian view is that sexual preferences (paraphilias included) are indeed formed in childhood.

7.	Devoteeism is programmed so as to provide partners for disabled people;

8.	Religious, occult, and esoteric explanations include hypotheses that devoteeism is sent from a higher force to test devotees and improve them by means of denial or that it is evidence of past lives.

   Wannabe Explanations

Wannabes have not formulated explanations for the discomfort they feel, other than those listed above. A formulation doubtless borrowed from transsexuals is that for reasons unknown the soul of one with a disability sometimes finds its way into an able body and desires adjustment to the physical reality.

   Of Disabled People

Since the disabled community is broad and diverse, explanations here emerge from that portion of it which is aware of devoteeism and whose members have in some cases adhered to the devotee community. Generally, they support devotee explanations, but with a deeper distinction between ‘devotees’ and a denigrated category of ‘fetishists’ who engage in aforementioned unacceptable and/or intrusive behaviour.

Standpoints

   Of Devotees

Devotees reject scientific approaches to the paraphilia on the grounds that scientific enquiry would throw an unhealthy shadow over them. Devotees are minded to move towards coalescing as a lifestyle community after the fashion of the gay community; today, scientific enquiry concerning the latter is generally viewed as unnecessary and discriminatory. Similarly to the gay community which rejected the term ‘homosexuality’ in favour of ‘gayness,’ devotees reject terms like ‘amelotasis’ and ‘apotemnophilia’ in favour of internal ones like ‘devoteeism.’

The community harbours conflicting views on wannabes. While pretending, until recently condemned, is today accepted as an unedifying fact of devotee life, many devotees feel wannabes have no place in their community.
Devotees claim that the attraction appears deviant only from the unacceptable position that disabled people are intrinsically unattractive. Other claims are honed to present the attraction in a better light, such as the statement that devotees support the civic movement of people with disabilities.

   Of People with Disabilities

Despite the proliferation of devotee websites and fora, most disabled people remain unaware of devoteeism. Those newly-introduced to it often react with shock and incomprehension. Nevertheless, hundreds of disabled people offer photographs and video clips of themselves for sale to devotees. This may be interpreted as approval, but also as economic accommodation. If membership of devotee fora is a sign of approval, by mid-2006, there was one disabled person for every ten devotee members of such fora.

Among disabled people aware of devoteeism, positive opinions are that the two sides were “made for each other.” They state that disabled people ought not to be seen as a-priori unattractive and devoid of sexuality, and that devotees may play a positive role in this regard (Inside, The Outsiders Club, London, 1979 et seq.).

Neutral opinions of disabled people aware of devoteeism are that everything in a relationship with a devotee is entirely ordinary. Negative opinions focus on the aforementioned unacceptable behaviours. A fundamental criticism concerns the inevitable stress placed by devotees on the difference between people with disabilities and able-bodied people. This is seen as a brake on integration, an aspect of which is public ‘blindness’ as to such differences.

   Of Observers

An issue raised by feminists (though political correctness hampers its airing to some extent) is the disparity of motivations. In a putative relationship, devotees would first seek physical satiety, while their potential partners would seek satisfaction of a significantly broader range of human aspirations. This disparity ceases to be a consideration only in a purely sexual contact, yet there one ought to bear in mind possible inequalities between devotees and their partners.
The major issue of wannabes is rather less abstract. It concerns medical and general ethics, as well as a number of legislations which prohibit self-harm.

Treatment

Literature describes therapeutic consultations with devotees, but does not describe therapeutic procedures undertaken, or their outcomes. Psychiatry considers devoteeism a deviation which can be treated by psychoanalysis, psychotherapy, counselling, or aversion therapy. Sexology does not consider the mainstream aspect of devoteeism a deviation and does not prescribe treatments. The devotee community is against therapeutic intervention for devotees but is possibly in favour if it with wannabes.

== [[E3-Band]] ==
{{#switch:|accept={{afc a}}|mm={{afc mm}}|#default={{afc r}}}}


A prominent Australian boyband, emerging in 2005, are a trio united by ethnic differences and rugged good looks. The three, Sterlo, Seva the Pimp and C.Magick, originally began with solo careers but eventually combined forces to create the worlds greatest all male group in the world. Each member of the band have a unique and gangster personality developed from childhood experiences. Sterlo is the musculine rapping black gangster, Seva is the hard eastern pimping Russian gangster, while C.Magick is the soft, handsome and intelligent Asian Kungfu gangster similar to that of Edison Chen. They do not confine themselves to one style and have created a mix of musical genres to create a very distinct sound. Their unique lyrical miracles and smooth dance moves by C.Magick eventually led to a prestigious award for their music video for L in 2005, which can be viewed on their official website www.e3-crib.co.nr. The prize, although lost by Sterlo, was a symbol of their greatness and the hard work which has lead them to worldwide fame. Their number 1 hits include, L and Bad Breath, all written and performed by E3 themselves. They also have recorded the theme song for the new National Rugby League Season for 2006.

Peter Warr is a former Formula 1 team manager, most famous for his fractious relationship with Nigel Mansell whilst serving as team manager under Colin Chapman at Lotus in the mid-eighties.

He is alleged to have been quoted as saying that Mansell "would never win a Grand Prix as long as I have a hole in my arse", subsequently proved wrong as Mansell went on to 31 career victories and a world championship in 1992

After Chapman's death, and Mansell's departure to Williams, Warr enjoyed considerable sucess at Lotus with a young Ayrton Senna before the team fell into decline at the end of the decade.

Mansell was very critical of Warr in his autobiography, and many fans would love to read Warr's side of the story.  At one stage it was thought Peter would be writing an autobiography but it would seem this plan has been abandoned.

Warr now resides in France.

ABOUT THE LORD OF AJASSA 

The Nigerian Hip Hop scene is rapidly evolving and one of the new bright stars is the Lagos rhymesayer known as Lord of Ajasa. 

The Lord of Ajasa brings an interesting dimension to the rap game with his kamikaze flow and compelling use of Yoruba street lingo. Some may argue that these qualities are not enough to set him apart from Nigeria's army of jobbing rappers considering the fact that his themes are not a radical departure from the debauchery that characterizes today's rap music. But those with keen ears will readily agree that this Akure, Ondo State bred rapper has given us some of the wittiest and most laconic lines ever delivered in Yoruba language. 

Born Olusegun Osaniyi, Lord of Ajasa's interest in Hip Hop started in the early 90's when he began to pay attention to rappers like Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Ice-T, KRS-One and NWA. Like most young rappers, he first started mimicking joints by these MCs before he started writing and delivering his own rhymes. As time progressed, he saw the need to develop his own style, one that he would not only be comfortable with, but would also appeal to a greater number of Hip Hop enthusiasts who couldn't really decipher and appreciate the lyrics of their favourite American rap stars or their counterfeit Nigerian counterparts. He started delivering his rhymes in Yoruba with a sprinkling of English and Pidgin, and focused on themes that portrayed the numerous frolics of street-smart Yoruba youngsters in contemporary Lagos. His chosen moniker, Ajasa is a Yoruba word for flavour. 

Lord of Ajasa has just released his debut album, a 12 track set titled, "It's tooooo much" Produced by Ajasa and his collaborative partner, Idowu Olumide a.k.a ID Cabasa.

The Lord of Ajass is one of the hot new stars from MGN Productions. He hails from Nigeria and has been entertaining since he was a child. He is out now on Blue Pie Productions for the world and is available at all leading digital retailers.

== Genetic Counsellor ==

Genetic counselling translates scientific knowledge into
practical information. Providers of genetic counselling
have a strong background in biology, and in particular,
genetics.
Genetic counsellors are health professionals with specialized
education, training, and experience in medical
genetics and counselling. They help families understand
birth defects and how inheritance works. They provide
information to help families make personal decisions
about pregnancy and child care. A genetic counsellor
works with a person or family who may be at risk for
inherited disease or an abnormal pregnancy outcome by
discussing the chances of having children who are affected.
When you go to see a genetic counsellor, he or she
will record your medical background and family medical
history. The counsellor may arrange appointments
for blood tests, physical exams, or amniocentesis in order
to put together a picture of how your family's health
may affect your children. Genetic counsellors also help
you interpret medical information about any risks present
and explain the role of genetics for these conditions.
Often, they can determine the risk of occurrence or recurrence
of a condition and the availability of tests for
it.

Clint Thomas was born in Greenup, Kentucky in 1896. Thomas was an outfielder and second baseman in the Negro Leagues from 1920-1937, where he earned the nickname "Hawk" for his sharp eyed hitting and center field skills. During his career Thomas spent time playing, most notably, with the New York Black Yankees, but also with the Brooklyn Royal Giants, Columbus Buckeyes, Detroit Stars, Hilldale , Bacharach Giants, New York Lincoln Giants, New York Cubans, Newark Eagles, and Philadelphia Stars. During his nearly 20 year career Thomas racked an impressive 400 home runs and 4,000 career hits and was a member of the 1925 and 1926 Eastern Colored League Championship Philadelphia Hilldale teams.
Thomas joined the New York Black Yankees in 1931 and, the following year, "ruined" the opening of Greenlee Field by scoring the only run and making a game saving catch in the Black Yankees defeat of [[Satchel Paige]]'s Philadelphia Crawfords.
After his baseball career ended, Thomas took work at the Virginia State House, where one of his duties was to make coffee for the state legislators.

'''Casey Eugene Nichols ( whom doesn't know anything about Wikipedia, and would never write an article on himself to blow up his ego) is the current yearbook and newspaper adviser for Rocklin High School.  He has been the yearbook adviser since the school's opening in 1994, and was also the newspaper at that time.  As of the 2005-2006 school year, he again became newspaper adviser.

As yearbook adviser, he won the 2004 National Yearbook Adviser of the Year from JEA. http://www.jea.org/awards/yaoy04.html

He graduated with a master's degree from Ball State, and has experience as a journalist and yearbook adviser.  He been an adviser for 11 years at the middle school level and 13 years at the high school level.  Also, he was an adviser at Burris Lab School in Muncie, Indiana, while attending Ball State.

He became an intern at a local paper the summer after he graduated from high school, and he became the sports editor of the 10,000 circulation paper at the age of 18. He served as sports editor from 1972 to 1979. He wrote, designed, photographed, and edited 1 to 2 broadsheet pages every day, covering five area high schools and Sacramento regional sports for the Roseville Press-Tribune.

Lastly, he created the curriculum for a Photojournalism class, which shoots the majority of the yearbook photographs and prepares students for futures in photography and photojournalism.

His main goal is to always improve the yearbook at Rocklin High School.  He believes that everything can always get better, and has reiterated that if he ever made a perfect yearbook, he would resign his post as adviser and retire.

== [[Fat Link]] ==

A fat link is a special type of [[hyperlink]] that opens more than one page. Now that many [[web browsers]] support [[tabbed browsing]], it's more potentially useful than ever to have one link that opens up multiple pages (in seperate tabs), and thus lets users access several destinations with one click. [[Bookmarks]] can be considered a special kind of link; so the [[Firefox]] web browser's ability to open multiple bookmarked pages at once from one "link" could thus be considered a special type of fat link.

==The Worth of a Man==

What this Man is really worth!
Is set in struggle, from his birth.
Throughout the span of shortened dearth,
so longing to gain a sense of worth.
Told, by those gathered round,
"Its in his hands,"
where “worth” is found.” Wearied,
by those who measured his task.
So, now his strength does fail to last.
For if to look within this Man.
Is to know it's not his hand,
whereby we know the worth of this Man,
But, by the gift,
so given for him to have
this Man forgiven of sin.
From the one whom “worth” is given.
As if he where the only Man living.

The Rev.

USE YOUR OWN WORDS; do not copy content from another website. --&gt;Enveloped deep within the crevasse of a cold and dark mountain cave, stumbles a very weary worn, and tattered eaglet, struggling to find a safe place for which to molt. The helpless, immature and undeveloped fowl instinctively knows that if it is to survive, it must search out a smooth and flat-faced rock of sufficient density, to beat its head on.

In order to break open the thick and crusting hide of its fledgling body. And, if it is not properly hidden from predators, it will be devoured before its birth into maturity arrives. Now, that this body’s skin has reached the end of this stage of development, and is tightening around its muscles and slowly chocking the life out of it. And it will not continue to live if it does not grow out of it. For this insufficient skin cannot form the mature feather with which it must have to fly above all other birds of the earth.

And with the breaking of this outer hide causes the blood to flow out of its head. And as the blood flows, it blinds the flow to the outside world. Now, alone in the dark it must use all of its God-given strength to remove this old hide that it keeping it from its full ability to soar. The blood softens the crust around the mouth, and eyes and can now be scraped off by the same rock which it has beaten its head against, for what would seem to be a life time.

For three days it hides in the darkness of the world, falling on the rock to remove this dead skin from its body. It is defenseless from any attackers that would happen upon it; therefore it must act in a way unbecoming of an Eagle it must humble itself, and hide from the sunlight. But at the end of this endless ordeal, emerges strengthened and renew and in its new body of maturity in which it now Soars!
The Rev.

In this last hour, there is a grievous crisis within the body of Christ. A great dependence on the traditions and denominations of men has befallen it. The teachings of men have brought confusion to the body of Christ. God’s people have been lulled into believing that the greater the emotional draw, and ‘entertainment flare’ equals a closer the walk with God. Believing that the greater the number of members is proof of the greater the walk with God. Steering the church into an emotional dependency in man, and not a spiritual dependency in God. Making the church powerless, and unable to find her place of authority in the Kingdom of God.

The church holds these teachings as Gospel, and therefore not searching out the Word to find the truth, personally. The church has become dull of hearing. Not knowing, the voice of the Holy Spirit in their personal lives. The denominationalism of the church has kept Man in his spiritual infancy. This has cause Man to take on a religious nature. The carnal mind, and the souls of men have been given power over the people. Through conflict and strife the church, has built impassable walls. Even to the point of hatred, and envy between denominations. Because of this God has hidden this word, for The Sons to discover. For this purpose, I began to hear the voice of God, but at the time I did not, fully understand what God was showing me. I have throughout my walk been given insight into God’s Word through spiritual discernment, and the power of His spoken word, and symbolism.

Through the mind of Christ, working in me. “I pray that Lord of Hosts lead you as you read these words”. ‘Let this mind be in you’ which is in Christ Jesus. I have been given, to see man’s manipulation through the translations of the Word. And, that it is imperative to those who are ‘the called’ according to His purpose; ‘the Sons of God’… know the truth of the Word in this hour. This is the beginning of the revelation into the “mysteries” of the Word… I would let it be known that I do not hold any of these truths of myself, nor do I exalt myself of anything. But I digress, All Praise and the Glory be unto Him, who sits on the throne. ‘The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords’, Amen… Let us begin, by setting some foundational truths, and understandings in Genesis. First, God has created Man, a spiritual creature, first, and then a physical form, second. The physical formation of man comes through the working of the fall, later, much later in his walk with God.

As a result of Mans encounter with the mixture of “good and evil”, Man began to indulge himself in rational thought, through the carnal mind. And this being new to Man, and being unprepared, because of doubt, he began to look at God’s creation through the eyes of limitations, and want. He began to see through the mind of fear, and doubt. In this new realm the Man hide himself. *Gen 3:9 And Jehovah God calleth unto the man, and saith to him, `Where art thou?' *Gen 3:10 and he saith, `Thy sound I have heard in the garden, and I am afraid, for I am naked, and I hide myself.' *Gen 3:11 And He saith, `Who hath declared to thee that thou art naked? Of the tree of which I have commanded thee not to eat, hast thou eaten?' We have for thousands of years hide among the “trees of men”. Here our Father asks, Adom ‘who has told you were naked?’ And the answer is, his carnal mind, twisted through satan ‘the traducer’. Through the weighing of good and evil through ‘reason’ Man began to believe a lie, through the twisting of the truth.

*Gen 3:5 for God doth know that in the day of your eating of it--your eyes have been opened, and ye have been as God, knowing good and evil.' Man had began to except his carnal, and physical world as reality, and not just a part of the sleep under which God had placed him, to form him, and to perfect his soul-‘Eve’. God seeing the Man had partaken of ‘the knowledge’ of good and evil, God formed Man with all of the necessary senses, to walk out this process, of knowing good and evil in this physical world. God clothed the man with skins (not the skins of beasts), but the enclosure in which we now walk. This is the formation of Man into a physical body. This is “The Fall of Man”. This ‘makes man’ flesh, as a result of the fall into the mixture. Man is now a Hued-Man, or as we know it ‘Human’.

This is literally a mixed-up Man, because Man cannot see the plan of God from within the fall. These are two distinctly different events in Man’s walk with his Creator. First, that which is spiritual, timeless, and boundless, and then that which is natural, flesh, limited, measured, and counted. Man is an eternal being, as is his Father, God. This is the process, which God has chosen to complete Man, to know the fullness of good and evil, which brings man to the understanding of the great gift, which God has given unto man through the working of the cross. This must be the beginning, of understanding, and that Man is on the path of perfection, even today. Walking through good and evil within the garden of man’s spirit. Man is beginning to see the fullness of his relationship with his Father.

Through, man’s struggle to return to the Father, without spot or blemish. Perfected! Knowing this is the very fabric of God’s Word, and Man’s true understanding of it. For it is the pleasure of the King to hide a mystery, and the honor of the ‘sons’ to revel unto the World. In Genesis Chapter 1:1. From the very beginning God has set Man’s place within His Creation, to set first Heaven ‘Man’s –spirit’, and then his Earth-‘soul’. Man is the instrument in His hand, in every part of God’s creation, from the very beginning. Man lived within the Father in Eternity in a timeless state of perfection, for countless eons before the fall. This is why *Gen 1:26 And God saith, `Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them rule over fish of the sea, and over fowl of the heavens, and over cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth.'

*Gen 1:27 And God prepareth the man in His image; in the image of God He prepared him, a male and a female He prepared them. God prepared Man ‘male and female’ in one being in Himself. Let Us – translated Elohym, which is ‘Gods’ plural- ‘the Father and His sons’ “Alpha and Omega” “ The First Adom, and the Last Adom” are making- ‘forming’ a body in which to express Himself in His own image. As the woman creates a child inside her womb, God creates through man’s womb ‘Eve- the soul, the church’. *Gen 1:28 And God blesseth them, and God saith to them, `Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over fish of the sea, and over fowl of the heavens, and over every living thing that is creeping upon the earth.’ Truly this World is at the pinnacle of evil in this last day.

We are so ready to blame satan ‘the traducer’ - for all mans ills. Jesus, from the foundation of the world ‘is’ slain, and that gift has set man again, as rightful owner of this world, not satan. Making a shame of him openly, by the cross. To further compress this point,’ God’s asks JOB ‘where were you when, “I”! ‘The masculine identity of God’, which also is the spirit of- man, when the stars of heaven sang together’? The answer to this is certainty that JOB was in God when the stars sang together. Let us now understand that this is, in “the beginning” of the creation, and that it is present tense and continuing, and not passed tense. God’s works are not governed by time, nor should we be. Also, God is the being of eternity, as are we. God has “set” (as a jeweler sets a stone in it’s crown)“Man” as the rightful heir of all things.

Let us now look again to this ‘first Adam’. “Adam” therefore this is not the first Adam’s name, but it is translated Adom “red, as in the first blood of God”. The Father, named him the man… “The Light Bearer”, *1966 in the Strongs Concordance which is translated “The Morning Star”, and that he is “ The Covering Cherub” which covers the World. He is charged to protect, groom, and to keep it, and to have dominion over it. The first Adom, ‘remember that which is first is last and that which is last is first’. The twain made “ONE” so making peace. The Alpha and Omega is the instrument through which God manifested Light to all His creation. Let us take in depth look at the man that God is making. First and foremost he is a creature of Light, possessing all understanding of good, in righteousness. Full of knowledge, and wisdom.

Remember that man named all life on the planet without flaw or blemish “perfect in beauty”. Knowing all, seeing all, possessing all ability, and that he is perfect in beauty, He is surly a true reflection of his Father, in every since of good. But now in* Gen 2:17 “and of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou dost not eat of it”, for in the day of thine eating of it—(in) dying thou dost die, note this is present tense and continuing. And now we see a great gulf formed between the man and his Creator, a lack of balance within the soul of man. Having no experience, of the order of creation. Man could not know the great gift, which God had given him. The gift of ‘Eternal Life’, life without pain, suffering, or any such corruption or death. Man has no understanding by comparison, of good without evil.

This creature is only half-perfected, only half-complete. Void of any understanding of evil, which is the balance within the content of creation. Thus, the man took into himself a mixture; of the “knowledge of” good and evil, and to that end came ‘The Fall” through the will of the Father. * Rom 8:20 ‘for to vanity was the creation made subject--not of its will, but because of Him who did subject it --in hope’, Now, this is the stage of Gods completion of man in the fullness of his glory in this last day. Through the fall came the introduction of evil into the “soul-Eve of man”, by the work of the traducer. Let it be know that we, ‘the sons of God’ are still within the Garden of Eden, but fallen, or as it is know the Hued.

This opened man to the carnal realm of thought, and reason to walk in. The soul of man began to consider what had been spoken to him by the serpent, Gen 3:5 for God doth know that in the day of your eating of it--your eyes have been opened, and ye have been as God, knowing good and evil.' ‘ Ye have been as God’ which is the truth. They truly are in many ways like God. Eternal, powerful, full of knowledge, and ability. We see man has been subjected to vanity, to complete him, to make him in God’s image, knowing both good and evil. God would not have asked Adom to subdue and have dominion over the whole world if Adom did not have the ability to do it. In this last day, we see many things hindering Man in his walk with God.

In Rev 12:3 ‘And there was seen another sign in the heaven’, and, lo, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his head seven diadems, Rev 12:4 and his tail doth draw the third of the stars of the heaven, and he did cast them to the earth; and the dragon did stand before the woman who is about to bring forth, that when she may bring forth, her child he may devour; The third of the stars which the dragon cast down, are those who followed the first Adom in the partaking of the fruit of ‘the tree of good and evil’. Let it be proclaimed there are those who did not to follow ‘the first Adom’. These are ‘the called’, ‘the Sons of God’. They did not hide from God as first Adom did, but did ask forgiveness for their sin, and where redeemed from ‘the fall’.

Not being cast out of heaven as ‘the first Adom’ is. Man by design is the ruler of this world, given to him by his Father. Once forfeited, to satan by the ‘first Adom’. This is why God had to become a Man to redeem the earth back to Man, by the ‘Last Adom’. He now, has redeemed all back to Man, by Jesus Christ. This was fulfilled when Jesus when in to hell, and took the keys of death, hell, and the grave, from satan. Thus, the Vail of the Temple is rent in twain, from top to bottom which only God could do, to allow the first Adom back into heaven. This speaks of the offspring of ‘the Last Adom’ The Man-child of Revelation 12:13 through this revelation we now see that God has given man a hand in all of his creation, to bring it into perfection.

This sets man in the place of authority a rule, and that Man bears responsibility for the present condition of this world. To know this is to know who, and what we are in Him, through growth and enlightenment in the presence, and guidance of the Holy Spirit. This in knowing the order of creation from glory to glory, and that through the knowing the fullness of Him, within us. We will begin, within the soul of the rejuvenated, by placing the heart in the realm of His presence, which is where He is given place to reign. And, being able to listen to His voice, the still small voice within. To be set in this place means to be shaken to your very core, spirit, soul, and body. Through the observing of the cycle of this placing in our natural lives “by living through lying vanities”, and what are the things which Man observes?

They are those things, which pull us away from our center, “our origin”, our beginning. That we have in us, as stated in the Word, Man was, and has always have been with God in every aspect of the creation, from beginning to end of this natural realm and beyond. We through these underlying truths, have always known this in our spirit, that it is He in us, and we in Him, for without Him was “nothing” made that was, and is made. We are irremovable from Him, as He is from us. It is the purpose of this natural realm to bring Mankind to the knowledge of that entire God, the Father, which has given unto them who are the called unto His purpose. It is the heart of the Father to bring His sons to an awareness of what goes on around them, and why. And how it is the Spirit within which guides them into all realms of Life, beyond this natural plane.

Now, preceding through this seeming unregenerate state that Man is now succumbed too the knowledge of failure, and lack, which he had never known or experienced before. For now with every thought, he will now discover doubt within himself, in every task, and in every thought, which he encounters. With the constant nagging of his carnivorous mind, in wanting, and demanding more, and more from his newly unfolding lusts! To the point of utter rage, and arrogance. He is becoming aware of his natural abilities through which he can now walk out of the spiritual realm, from which He was created, and away from his imaged control of God. Man himself has been made aware of the carnivorous mind, and that it now can be controlled by the knowledge of evil, which is presented through him, by satan.

Which is the every thing that the serpent uses to speak to Man, through his soul (Eve) feeding his carnivorous desires with all the base things of this natural realm, which He had never before encountered. Man now has through his own mind become a “god” having a traduced sense of right and good, and wrong, and evil. The serpent has twisted; every thought through this newly formed process of (self) reasoning. Thou hast said in thine heart “I will” (the act of self awareness), the effect of which is now seemingly to be apart from God’s presence. Before, Man did as God instructed him without question, until God placed Man in the final stage of maturity through the encrypting of the knowledge of evil into Man’s consciousness ‘desires’. Although there were no outward manifestations of what Man had encountered through this hewing knowledge of evil.

This change is reveled though what God had asked the Man in the Garden “Where are you Adom?” God reveled to Man through Man’s own words, that something had changed within the Man, to now believe that he was naked. God asked,” who told you, you were naked”? God had not lost Man, nor had Man’s outward appearance changed. But now because of Man’s hued state it was now impossible for Man to remain in the glory of the Garden of God “The Holiest of all”. Therefore the Man must by reason of his now hued, limited, and tainted state, be removed from the purity of the Garden. Now, Man is to miss “the mark”, in all that he does, he will now suffer loss, and lack, in every thing which dwells here in this natural plane. To know nothing save Him crucified.

So that through all this Man will know that “all is vanity, and vexation of spirit” (within this hued state) sayeth the Lord. Only through the suffering of evil can Mankind know that “the observing of lying vanities will he forsake his own mercy”. Now, that the Man is under the influence of vanity, “not willingly, but by reason of Him who subjected the same “in hope”. And now subjected, to bring forth the New Man (the inward Man of the heart) within this earthen vessel. These are to manifest, to bring “all of Mankind” into the rest of God the Father. Now that Man is no longer under the slavery of sin (the missing of the mark) of the prize of the high calling, but that we are now in Christ Jesus.

To know this is to know who, and what we are in Him, through growth and enlightenment in the presence, and guidance of the Holy Spirit. This in knowing the order of creation from glory to glory, and that through the knowing the fullness of Him, within us. We will begin, within the soul of the rejuvenated, by placing the heart in the realm of His presence, which is where He is given place to reign. And, being able to listen to His voice, the still small voice within. To be set in this place means to be shaken to your very core, spirit, soul, and body. Through the observing of the cycle of this placing in our natural lives “by living through lying vanities”, and what are the things which Man observes?

They are those things, which pull us away from our center, “our origin”, our beginning. That we have in us, as stated in the Word, Man was, and has always have been with God in every aspect of the creation, from beginning to end of this natural realm and beyond. We through these underlying truths, have always known this in our spirit, that it is He in us, and we in Him, for without Him was “nothing” made that was, and is made. We are irremovable from Him, as He is from us. It is the purpose of this natural realm to bring Mankind to the knowledge of that entire God, the Father, which has given unto them who are the called unto His purpose.

It is the heart of the Father to bring His sons to an awareness of what goes on around them, and why. And how it is the Spirit within which guides them into all realms of Life, beyond this natural plane.

The Rev.

&lt;!-- Place the initial content of your article below this line. USE YOUR OWN WORDS; do not copy content from another website. --&gt;The Eye of the Frog, science tells us the frog has a focused range of sight. Though it is extremely limited, but very detailed is in its over-all range of vision. It only focuses on one thing at time. Thereby it is extremely vulnerable, and it can not defend itself from behind, especially when gorging it self, so it must have a very adaptive skin, to ward off potential predators, they breathe through it, they constantly shed it, and even produce toxins with it.

The frog is a very difficult animal to befriend, it is constantly on the move in pursuit of prey, and is know at times even to eat their own, all others in the animal kingdom know of its dangerously anti-social behavior and defer form crossing paths with it. It will sit on one place until all environmental resources are consumed; it defecates, and drinks from the same water source. It will even eat until it bursts.

Throughout life’s journey we have all come across ‘frogs’ who have very limited views of life, and how it came to be. Their focus is on only one or two points which they base their entire view of life on, and because they do not have the ability to defend themselves through conversation, because of their limited views, and that they are constantly gorging they selves to fill their enormous egos. They develop a very toxic nature repelling anyone whom they consider a threat to their view of life.

If one tries to develop a relationship, or touch them they will secrete an offensive and often deadly barrier between themselves and those who try to touch them. They have no restraint even when it comes to procreation of their views; they will pile-on in order to intimidate as many others as possible.

They will over-take an area until all others are as they are, or until they run them out of their resource. How many frogs do you know?

==  The intended influential nature , which is called ‘evil' ==

&lt;!-- IMPORTANT!  In the box above, put the name of your proposed article.  Place [[ and ]] around it, [[like this]]. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Place the initial content of your article below this line. USE YOUR OWN WORDS; do not copy content from another website. --&gt;For it is impossible for a natural being to grasp even the most elementary of the super-natural laws, because there are no constructs of understanding to which it can relate. Extreme pressures applied to the known laws, do thereby nullify them, resulting in an incomprehensible application of influence by the super-natural which supercedes the function of the natural, until there are no longer any known relationships to point too, ‘as being natural’ resulting in that no longer be perceived, ‘as natural’, but super-natural.

Beyond the natural, are thinly veiled but perceivable realities, where the monumental events of beings of awe, and wonder do express themselves! Creatures obscured of unbelievable nature, a ‘super-natural nature’ observing, influencing and intervening into the very fabric of the natural world. Guiding the course of man’s nature to, a being which knows the nature of the unseen i.e. ‘The Super -Natural’- 'the super position of spirit from all living things' where the only source of infinite power and understanding of all that is,is. Within the Super-verse, is teeming with all of its multi-layered pan-dimensional realities of Life.

The intended influential nature of that, which is called ‘evil’, is by design, pervasive throughout the formation of the ‘natural hu-man psyche’, where an ‘inherent void’ is formed in its genesis, which must be nurtured and reared within the confines of the natural laws, to its eventual transcendent maturity. Therefore without the necessary ability to comprehend what is occurring within the mind, man responds in the only way he could, with fear, doubt, ‘confusion’, and dismay.

Fearing that which he did not understand through any prior exposure. The traducer through those inherent qualities of the hu-man psyche i.e. consciousness, intention, and emotion became reactionary in its relationship to the truth, therefore twisting it to be conform to the now perceived natural laws, which caused the man to question his very origin, and validity, therefore questioning the very foundation upon which he was formed and instructed.

He then began to believe in the twisting of the super natural laws, into natural, which prior, he had been eternally accustomed, as he experiences the natural laws, they began to debase him into a lowly carnal creature, and then from that point on, the hu-man physic began to relate to his environment through this newly gestated evil of fear, and doubt. At this onset in this dulled and unfamiliar environment, he began to function as a physical being, disregarding his super-natural origin, conversely behaving ‘as’ a mere hu-man creature.

As the indulgences of his hu-man desire began overwhelmed his super-nature, bit-by-bit, and now day-by-day, until he will subsequently loose the ability to converse with the super-natural, all together. From then on he has become the self-determinating factor within his natural plane, he suspends it by the acceptance of the substances of low energies i.e. particulate and wave, being his interpretive interaction.

Which causes him to process his surrounding environment as being reality, when it is a perception of fear through what he now sees as reality. Thereby building for his mind ‘a cognitive prison’ which is so believably strong that there are no means by which he can break free from it with his adherence to his acceptance of natural surroundings.

The Rev.

Religious leaders throughout time in memorial have caused an overwhelming fear to resonate within the populace, and within the church, about this particular number when it is the spiritual influence which they themselves have invoked upon it, which causes fear to be given place within the minds and hearts of the undiscerning.

The mark of the beast is in-fact:

‘The deification of man’
6 (hex-ak-os’-ee-oy) - in actions of man
6 (hex-ay’-kon-tah) - in the mind of man
6 (hex)- in the body of man

Works without spirit, just as the tower of Babel was a work to reach God through works. It is the acceptance of the being of man the highest achievement of all knowledge attainable. It must be received in the mind, (as a mind-set) or in the hand (as a relational association with the evil of human intellect), The worship of ‘Self’.

Gen 11:9
Therefore 5921, 3651 is the name8034 of it called7121 Babel; 894 because3588 the LORD3068 did there8033 confound1101 the language8193 of all3605 the earth: 776 and from thence4480, 8033 did the LORD3068 scatter them abroad6327 upon5921 the face6440 of all3605 the earth.776


It is the computation of man’s abilities in knowledge apart from wisdom; literally it is a man without a spirit ‘a beast’, a construct, and a soulless form. Many learned men have computed the meanings of this mark of the *beast when it is the revelation of the fullness of the arrogance of man’s accumulation of knowledge unto ‘self-worship’, man himself has made himself ‘the god of this world’.

So, God has confused man, so that he will not manifest fourth this mutated image of God to worship, which is what man is trying to do. To bring fourth an image of God in man’s distorted image the worship of self.

The interpretations of prophecies which speak of the ‘mark’, and ‘end-times’ which have been interpreted by carnal understandings of the intellectual mind, and not through the discernment of the Holy Spirit, resulting in a delusional understanding of the God’s message to man.

Leaving man lost in a mixture of half-truths. This is a culmination of intellectual religious traditions and blended with folklore casing the word of God to be of none effect, leaving man unprepared for the coming of the Lord with His reward.





Let us look at some of the most commonly misinterpreted verses of scripture:

1 Th 4:16
For3754 the3588 Lord2962 himself846 shall descend2597 from575 heaven3772 with1722 a shout, 2752 with1722 the voice5456 of the archangel, 743 and2532 with1722 the trump4536 of God: 2316 and2532 the3588 dead3498 in1722 Christ5547 shall rise450 first: 4412

For the Lord in person shall come from the hearts of His sons (heaven - the abode of God i.e. from our heart) for every ‘eye’ (the eye of the spirit is single) shall see Him, (not eyes, not from the sky, nor from satellites orbiting the Earth as is so taught in this technological age), He presences in us is the ‘catching-up’ which is spoken of in the Word, will take by force all evil from the soul of man, not man from the Earth, by His glory.

Joh 17:15
I pray2065 not3756 that2443 thou shouldest take142 them846 out of 1537 the3588 world, 2889 but235 that2443 thou shouldest keep5083 them846 from1537 the3588 evil.4190


He comes from within His people (the abode of God) Have we not asked Him to make up His abode in our hearts? He himself is our reward, which He has promised. In this unity the sons shall speak with ‘one voice’ with a ‘shout of victory’, which is the trump of God.

2Th 1:10
When3752 he shall come2064 to be glorified1740 in1722 his848 saints, 40 and2532 to be admired2296 in1722 all3956 them that believe4100 (because3754 our2257 testimony3142 among1909 you5209 was believed) 4100 in1722 that1565 day.2250

Gal 4:19
My3450 little children, 5040 of whom3739 I travail in birth5605 again3825 until891 Christ (5547) be formed3445 in1722 you, 5213

Eph 1:18
The3588 eyes3788 of your5216 understanding1271 being enlightened; 5461 that ye5209 may know1492 what5101 is2076 the3588 hope1680 of his846 calling, 2821 and2532 what5101 the3588 riches4149 of the3588 glory1391 of his846 inheritance2817 in1722 the3588 saints, 40

No longer shall we be apart from Him. Man will no longer walk in the mixture of ‘the knowledge of good and evil’, but only in the knowledge of God alone!

Ivan Del Santo Newton, or Ivo, was born on the 6th of December 1989, to the proud parents, Daryl Del Santo and Peter Newton. He was born and raised in the peacful London site of Shepperds Bush. He is a distant Realtion to the Famous Scientist Sir Issac Newton.

His only claim to fame was appearing in a BBC documentary about London in the 1800s.

Moving to Arabstan he found two wives, he searched for his third but most women in Arabstan are either to fat or to hairy.

A Legendary Tail passed down through generations was the the quest of his ancestor Lord Newton the 3rd where he defeated a female ogre using a bomb made out of kitchen appliences (mostly knives).
Ivo reinacted this act on 11th of July 2005 Ivo threw a Borthday cake at some fat women.

After passing his GCSEs (all A*) in the summer of 2006 he took a job as a farmer and grew magical herbs of which everyone enjoyed.

Ivo is recently missing but reports of sightings have popped up all across the globe
Many rumors say that Ivo was stolen for being far to good looking and being the only man with an eye made from the stars.

Ivo is a self proclaimed Genuis

I would be the first to admit it; if I had not had an experience which in no uncertain terms showed me that He does exists. 

Much of the human experience ‘is’ truly a delusion, without a doubt. That being said: That does not discount the fact that the spirit world is right here within our grasp, and all we have to do to see it, is to believe.  

I think that there is so much that is lost because of the disbelief in the abilities which God as given to man, from the beginning in the garden. God gave man the ability to govern the (world,) by comparison most people have trouble keeping their grass mowed, and groomed. So what kind of power does man have if God told man to have dominion over the entire Earth?  

I love seeing grown people act like children trying to prove their opinion, when by definition (an opinion) are entirely subjective to the individual. 

Glean much of human nature in the process

Contrary to the entire of course replies, mostly to insult some one’s intellect or lack thereof. There is an irrefutable constancy of denial by those who trust in science over intuition. This is the very thing, which dims their ability of insight into the unseen. Also I would ask those who live by logic, please explain the origin of energy and, to prove its existence.

Man is energy wrapped in flesh, and depending on hope.       
 
Man does not have dominion over the Earth in the natural,(not yet)
If he did he would not have to depend on man-made things to give him power of the elements.
‘Dominion’ - is not ‘control’ but harmony. Man is not in control of any part of the creation, much less the Earth. His is under the ‘control’ of his individual fears. This is not Dominion.

Try walking out your front door, and summon any type of animal you see, see if it obeys you? If not that you don’t have dominion in this Earth. 

A traditional hierarchy of angels ranked from lowest to highest into the following nine orders: angels, archangels, principalities, powers, virtues, dominions, thrones, cherubim, and seraphim

The nightmare is trying to get us to confront a problem in our life. Turn and confront the intruder, and find out what it wants.

Those who don’t learn from history, are condemned to repeat it, repeat it, repeat it, repeat it, 

If evolution is factual, and man is an off-shoot of the ape, then why are there still un-evolved apes on Earth?  

Through thought there are entryways into the natural realm, first it must be true and heart-felt, with a purpose. Through thought the elements of this natural realm is flexible to the intent of the heart. Then yes it will manifest. Some use this to curse, and others use it to bless. 

We who are of the eternal know, that our conscience is clear, and clean of all passed evils. We are in the present workings of the Eternal God. We have pass from death unto Life. This is not possible to those who are still bound by natural or scientific laws. This has brought us back to our original vibration before we where altered by the envelopment of flesh. 

There are those who have seen a glimpse of the Eternal but have dismissed it as delusion, because of the inability to accept this alternate reality. As long as those who are still confined by flesh are unable to commune with the Eternal, they will continue to dispute it as reality. It is impossible to know the eternal until you are able to let go of your doubt, and fear of the unknown.

The Rev.

Re-aging is the action of returning a facility that is in arrears but not in default to "performing" status without collecting the total amount of principal, interest, and fees that are contractually due - this is normally done by increasing the facility limit or restructuring the facility to include the excess arrears.

"Party Retard" is a general term for the young people who goes to a party and takes too much drugs until he or she goes out of control and looks weird / strange. The "Party Retard" term doesn't means
simply just somebody is ugly or not good looking - it means somebody does terrible weird looking things / gestures or outrageous movements in the public. "Party Retard" people often looks funny, pathetic or both.

Typically party retard inducated drugs are [[amphetamines]], [[cocaine]] and [[MDMA]] but too much [[alchohol]] could give the same unwanted effects.

Composed in 1938, Nobilissima visione was premiered by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo under the composer’s direction at Covent Garden, London, on July 21, 1928, with choreography by Massine.

Scoring: 2 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, percussion (snare drum, tenor drum, bass drum, glockenspiel, triangle, cymbals, and small cymbals), and strings.

Aside from Hindemith’s highly developed conception of the composer’s role as a social one, involving a moral duty to provide music that people can use and enjoy, the all-round character of his musicianship—he acquired a degree of competence in playing practically all of the orchestral instruments—suggests a return to the practice of the 18th century, when composers were normally skilled executants too. This tendency is in one sense reflected in his music, in which counterpoint often regains the central role it filled until the late baroque period. But it was perhaps in the sphere of harmony, where he developed a method admittedly less influential on other composers than that of his older contemporary Schoenberg but better fitted for the creative tasks he set himself. The great merit of his system is that, unlike Schoenberg’s 12-tone method, it is based on a natural rather than an arbitrary division of the octave: he treated notes as harmonics ultimately derived from one fundamental, grading chords from strong to weak according to how near their constituent notes were to the fundamental.

The ease and fluency attainable through such methods are clearly to be heard in a score like Nobilissima visione, which postdates the composer’s early period as a kind of enfant terrible, and instead calls to mind the warmth, underlying serenity, and, indeed, nobility of such familiar works as the symphony he similarly drew from his opera Mathis der Maler. The Nobilissima visione suite consists, the composer explained, “of those sections of the ballet score which are self-sufficient and comprehensible as concert music and which do not depend, therefore, on supplementary stage action.” His description of these sections is as follows:

The introduction consists of that part of the original music during which the hero of the action (St. Francis of Assisi) is sunk in deep meditation. The Rondo corresponds to the music in the stage score for the mystic union of the Saint to Mistress Poverty, the scene having been inspired by an old Tuscan legend. The music reflects the blessed peace and unworldly cheer with which the guests at the wedding participate in the wedding feast—dry bread and water only. The second movement pictures the march of a troop of medieval soldiers. First heard but distantly, their gradual approach is observed. The middle portion of this movement suggests the brutality with which these mercenaries set upon a traveling burgher and rob him. The third and closing movement, Passacaglia, corresponds to the portion of the ballet score representing the Hymn to the Sun. Here all the symbolic personifications of heavenly and earthly existence mingle in the course of the different variations through which the six-measure-long theme of the Passacaglia is transformed. In the ballet this closing piece bears a special title borrowed from a chapter heading in an old version of the Cantique du Soleil, which reads, “Incipiunt laudes creaturarum”—“Here begin the praises of all creatures.”

Perhaps the loveliest part of the whole score is the contemplative Pastorale that concludes the second movement, based on a theme remarkable for its combination of poetry and elegance. This melody exemplifies the rhythmic suppleness and the expressive, but never excessive, chromaticism at the heart of Hindemith’s finest music.

Their songs are seen by most as comments on society and politics, such as the jumpy 'Rat Life' and the very brutal 'Sitcom Reality' however the catchy number 'Lonesome' shows that these political punkers have a soft side to them also. Their influences are varied, from Capdown, The Specials and Operation Ivy, to the Living End and The Clash. Meaning they sound very up beat and modern whilst keeping a rawness not seen in the ska genre for some time. Ska/core has progressed and it seems The Stopouts are the next level up.

Before the fifteenth century manor houses needed to be fortified in case of attack to do this they had outer walls, a moat, a drawbridge and a portcullis.  Early drawings of manor houses illustrate this.  Lydiate hall itself shows evidence of a moat.  The windows were small as well. This changed in Elizabethan times when houses developed to have big, high windows with a symmetrical building.  An example being Hardwick house – 1590.  Lydiate hall doesn’t show evidence of this.  Manor houses were usually 2 to 3 stories high built around an open courtyard.  The manor houses built before the fifteenth century and were built from wood and so the kitchen was situated away from the main house to prevent the spread of fire.  The main living room had different uses including eating, sleeping and recreation.  The great hall at Lydiate reproduced from Rimmer in 1852 shows the large room with a table for eating and a fireplace.  This source is reliable because other manor houses show the same styles of great halls from that period.. Rufford old hall’s great hall shows exuberance of decoration and five hammerbeam trusses it also shows a table and fireplace. A bed can also be seen to the left of the picture.

During the fifteenth century threat of attack was lessened and so fortification was lessened.  The kitchen also became part of the house because the roof was vaulted to prevent the spread of fire.  Manor houses were built from brick, stone or half-timber.  There was more space for private bedrooms or receptions.  A porch was built and a barn for animals. Pictures from the guidebook of Lydiate hall from this period are useful to historians because it shows what manor houses looked like during the fifteenth century and they can compare the pictures from earlier illustrations and compare the sources to see how they have developed.

During the early sixteenth century timber became expensive and houses were built from stone or brick.  They had very large windows like those of Hardwick house.  The houses became a lot grander and spacious.  Pictures of Speke hall show it made these changes.  The house was rented out and used as a farmhouse.  Houses during Tudor times were still based around an open courtyard i.e. they were quadrangular.  The Speke hall guidebook shows a picture of the house designed around an open courtyard and the plans of the house also illustrate this clearly. Victoria county history describes Lydiate hall to be quadrangular around an open courtyard as well.  So there is sufficient evidence to support this.

Lydiate hall was typically tudur showing evidence of bay windows and chimneys being introduced.  The floor was made from wood and staircases were becoming more common in houses.  Pictures of Lydiate hall’s great hall show a staircase.  Timber framed bricks were introduced.  Other houses like Rufford old hall and Speke hall show these developments as well.  This proves that Lydiate hall did develop so it is useful to historians.  Hardwick hall is a late Tudor house built during the reign of the last Tudor monarch Elizabeth I. This shows typical Tudor symmetry and large high windows and a high building.

The plans of 1637 show the layout of Lydiate Hall before the demolition of the east wing in the 18th century.  It is therefore useful to historians who can look at how the layout of the manor house changed considering it is in ruins now.

During the 17th century manor houses became even larger and very symmetrical however Lydiate doesn’t show evidence of this and so shows it did not develop along with other manor houses like Speke hall.
The 18th century saw a farm building constructed in 1741 but elsewhere few changes took place at the manor house.  In 1741 it was found that the roof of the east block needed repairing but because the family live in another manor house, ins Blundell, it was pulled down and the house was rented out to be used for farming to a man called John Rimmer

Since that date the manor house has not developed to follow styles like others did but it was reconstructed to copy Elizabethan styles, like red brickwork and 16th century style windows.  This restoration could be useful to show historians how Lydiate hall would have looked like but may also not be useful because it might not show exact styles of the times.

Lydiate hall has had lots of restoration carried out and so there is little left of the original building work.  When I visited there was mainly remains of the red brick, which was used to restore the Manor house.  In 1960 there was a lot more timber at the site and some of it containing carvings and other examples of sixteenth century timberwork.  This would have been useful to historians. Historians can only use restored material and sources, which could be slightly inaccurate.  There is however opportunities with the decay of the house to see the materials used in the building and these can be dated.  Archaeological excavations have found the timber, which can be dated back to the medieval times when it was thought most of Lydiate hall was built.

In conclusion from when Lydiate hall was built until the end of the Tudor period it followed trends of the time and developed. This is evident in sources.  However after this period it stopped following the fashions and when the family decided not to repair the building it started to deteriorate and so is not a reliable source of development after that period because it is based on restoration work which may not be as reliable as other manor hoses like Hardwick house and Speke Hall.

This song is a response to fans who acuuse them of selling out. It was the first single off of Faceless. It was written by lead singer Sully Erna. Some claim that at the beginning of the song there is a tribute to the Metallica song "One," with gunshots and explosions and war sounds similar to the way "One" begins.
