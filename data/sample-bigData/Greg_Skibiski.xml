==Life and career==
The idea for Citysense started in 2006 when Skibiski approached [[Alex Pentland|Alex "Sandy" Pentland]] (Head of [[Human Dynamics]] Research at the [[MIT Media Lab]]) with the idea that large amounts of location data being collected by mobile phones and GPS devices could be useful to [[economists]].&lt;ref&gt;Junietz, Erika.
