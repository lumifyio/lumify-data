'''Violin Memory''' is a private American company based in [[Mountain View, California]], that designs and manufactures enterprise [[flash memory]] arrays that combine [[Toshiba America Electronic Components|Toshiba]] [[NAND flash]], [[DRAM]], distributed processing, and software to create solutions like [[Network-attached storage]] (NAS), [[Clustered file system|local clusters]], and QFabric data centers from [[Juniper Networks]].&lt;ref name="StorageSearch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.storagesearch.com/violin.html |title=Violin Memory |publisher=StorageSearch.com |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chubby_Brain"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chubbybrain.com/companies/violin-memory |title=Violin Memory Company Overview |publisher=ChubbyBrain.com |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded in 2005 by Jon Bennett who developed and patented the vRAID&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;http://www.google.com/patents/US8200887&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; switched memory technology used in the Violin products.&lt;ref name="Violin_Company"/&gt;

==History and financing==
Violin was re-founded and recapitalized by Don Basile, ex-CEO of Fusion-io.  He brought a few members of his previous team and has since grown the company to 450 employees and is now considered the leading flash Memory Array storage vendors in the industry.

Jon Bennett (Hardware CTO and Founder) held various senior level architect and engineering positions at [[Fore Systems]], BBN Technologies, [[Xylan]], RiverDelta Networks, and [[Motorola]]  where he invented the Violin Switched Memory (VXM)&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; technology.&lt;ref name="Chubby_Brain"/&gt;

[[Venture round|Series A financing]] valued over $10 million was raised in 2010. Two more [[Venture round|rounds of financing]] in 2011 raised an additional $75 million.&lt;ref name="Violin_Company"/&gt; The key corporate investors include [[Juniper Networks]] and [[Toshiba America Electronic Components]] (TAEC). 

[[Venture round|Series D financing]] $80 million Mezzanine round in 2012 led by SAP Ventures, [[Toshiba America Electronic Components]] (TAEC), Highland Capital, GSV and other large corporate partners &amp; crossover investment partners. The reported valuation was over $800 million &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2012/03/30/violin-memory-raises-32m.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On August 15, 2012 the [[San Francisco 49ers]] announced a partnership with the company in an effort to create the "Ultimate Fan Experience" in the new [[Levi's Stadium]] that started construction in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Francisco |first=San |url=http://www.49ers.com/news/article-2/49ers-Announce-Violin-Memory-as-Stadium-Founding-Partner/1f59db23-e270-4d0f-80c7-31d8f06a2b19 |title=49ers Announce Violin Memory as Stadium Founding Partner |publisher=49ers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2012 Violin acquired [http://www.gridironsystems.com/ Gridiron Systems] for an undisclosed sum.  They have taken both founders Som Sikdar and Herb Schneider as well as 20 engineers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.violin-memory.com/news/press-releases/violin-memory-acquires-gridiron-systems/&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2013 Violin announced the [http://www.violin-memory.com/products/velocity-pcie-cards/ Velocity line of PCIe cards] in a strategic alliance with Toshiba&lt;ref&gt;http://www.violin-memory.com/news/press-releases/violin-memory-completes-its-vision-of-a-memory-based-it-infrastructure-by-announcing-an-expansion-of-its-strategic-alliance-with-toshiba/?preview=true&amp;preview_id=9515&amp;preview_nonce=b2f10ff521&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
In September 2011 Violin launched the [http://www.violin-memory.com/products/6000-flash-memory-array/ 6000 Series flash Memory Arrays] which are all-silicon shared storage systems built from the ground up to harness the full power of flash memory and deliver industry leading performance and ultra low data access latencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://storagemojo.com/2012/04/11/violins-clean-sheet-architecture/&lt;/ref&gt; A single 3 rack unit tall array delivers up to 1 million IOPS and does so with consistent, spike free latencies measured in microseconds, a full order of magnitude lower than legacy Tier 1 storage solutions. This game changing combination of performance and sustained low latency makes the 6000 Series the storage of choice for high IOPS scale out virtual infrastructure configurations, transactional business critical applications with stringent response time service level agreements, and advanced real-time big data analytics environments.  

6000 Series flash Memory Arrays connect natively to existing 8Gbit/s Fibre Channel, 10GE iSCSI, and 40Gbit/s Infiniband network infrastructures. They are managed by the Violin Memory Operating System, providing a simple, easy GUI management interface for one or multiple enclosures. Provisioning storage for an application is simplified to the extreme. No RAID groups, storage silos, or storage tiers get in the way. New LUNs are automatically spread across the entire surface of the Flash Memory Fabric. Never worry about hotspots again; the raw performance capabilities of 6000 Series flash Memory Arrays eliminate storage bottlenecks and application latencies and simply make your shared storage as fast as memory.

==Benchmarks==
Violin flash Memory Arrays are commonly used to set database benchmark records, because they  are fast, reliable, and serviceable.  Violin systems’ vRAID&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; and hot-swap capabilities&lt;ref&gt;http://storagemojo.com/2012/06/13/hot-swap-in-a-non-ssd-flash-array/&lt;/ref&gt; are a critical requirement for database (TPC) testing because an active module must be failed during the audited performance run and the system must not go down and performance must be sustained.  Violin’s vRAID&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; architecture is uniquely capable of providing world record performance and cost while surviving hardware failures at both chip and module level. The benefits to real-world applications of the technologies and products used in these benchmarks include:

*     Very high sustained performance and transaction rates
*     Increased utilization of server/CPU cores and database licenses
*     Lower cost per I/O and database transaction/query
*     Lower power per database transaction/query
*     Ability to scale databases from 1TB to 100s of TBs.
