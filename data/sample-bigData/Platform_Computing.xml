In Jan 2012, Platform Computing was acquired by [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/36372.wss IBM Closes on Acquisition of Platform Computing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:PlatformComputing.jpg|thumb|Platform Headquarter in Canada.]]
Platform Computing was founded by Songnian Zhou, Jingwen Wang, and Bing Wu in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ogf.org/News/documents/ogf_winter_2007.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=OGF|title=GridConnections|accessdate=2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first product, LSF, was based on the ''Utopia'' research project at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.121.1434|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|title=Utopia: A Load Sharing Facility for Large, Heterogeneous Distributed Computer Systems|accessdate=2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSF software was developed partially with funding from [[CANARIE]] (Canadian Advanced Network and Research for Industry and Education).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20040720151637/http://www.canarie.ca/press/publications/tadeng.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=CANARIE|title=Shaping the future: success stories from the CARARIE files|accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Platform's revenue was approximately $300,000 in 1993, and reached $12 million in 1997. Revenue grew by 34% (YoY) to US$46.2 million in 2001, US$50 million in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=2005-09-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050927230807/http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/107/107204.html|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/107/107204.html|publisher=Yahoo Business|title=Platform Computing Inc.

On October 29, 2007, Platform Computing acquired the Scali Manage business from Norway-based Scali AS.
