'''agorum ''core''''' is a free [[Open-Source]] [[Enterprise Content Management]] system by ''agorum Software GmbH'' from [[Germany]]. One of the main features is the [[CIFS|Document-Network-Share]]. With that the documents within the ECM are shown as a normal network share. So it is usable like any other fileserver, you can use any program, that is able to access a normal drive (office-programs, scan-programs and so on). From the users' view the benefit is, that everything is working like before.

''agorum core'' is part of the [[Lisog]] open source stack initiative.

== History ==
The development of agorum ''core'' started in the year 2000. From there it has been redesigned several times to use the latest technologies. Till the end of 2007 the system had been distributed as [[proprietary software]]. In the beginning of  2008 the decision was made, to free most parts of the software under [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].&lt;br&gt;
Since the end of 2009 agorum core version 6.4.0 is available.

== Capabilities ==
agorum ''core'' itself is a Java (EJB)-based Software and the server part runs on most common Linux and Windows systems. The Client needs no installation. To access the server many common protocols are supported, like  [[Server Message Block#Common Internet File System (CIFS)|CIFS]], [[WebDAV]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]/HTTPs for the [[Webportal]], [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]]/[[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] for email programs, [[RSS]]-Feeds for notifications. Optional there is a windows client software available, to integrate the ECM into the operating system.

The system also consists of many other open source components. The installation routine offers the choice to directly install [[MySQL]] ([[InnoDB]]) or [[PostgreSQL]] databases.&lt;br&gt;
In the commercial version of 2009 there is a support for MS SQL.
The system is based on [[Enterprise JavaBeans|EJB]] technologie. [[JBoss]] is used as the EJB application server. [[Lucene]] is used as full text search engine. [[OpenOffice.org]] is used to extract the text for the search index. [[JasperReports|Jasper/iReport]] is used as an [[integrated reporting]] system. There is also an integrated [[Workflow]] component, based on [[jBPM]] from JBoss.
