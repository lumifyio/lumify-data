'''Xeround''' is a provider of [[cloud database]] software, launched in 2005.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=21008964 "Xeround"], ''[http://www.bloomberg.com Bloomberg.com]'', Retrieved 25-8-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded by Sharon Barkai and Gilad Zlotkin.

Xeround's product was initially used by [[Telecommunications service provider|Telecom providers]], including [[T-Mobile]];&lt;ref name="register" /&gt; in 2009 the company added a [[MySQL]] front end to its product,&lt;ref name="gigaom"&gt;Derrick Harris, [http://gigaom.com/cloud/for-xeround-mysql-in-the-cloud-knows-no-bounds/ "For Xeround, MySQL in the Cloud Knows No Bounds"], ''[http://gigaom.com/ GigaOM]'', Retrieved 25-8-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; making it applicable to a mass market of 12 million MySQL applications.&lt;ref name="forbes-mysql"&gt;Victoria Barret, [http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/20/mysql-marten-mickos-technology-enterprise-tech-mysql.html "Why Oracle Won't Kill MySQL"], ''[http://www.forbes.com Forbes.com]'', Retrieved 12-9-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The product allows MySQL users to scale their database and achieve high availability on [[Cloud computing|cloud]] platforms like [[Amazon EC2]].&lt;ref name="register"&gt;Timothy Prickett Morgan, [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/14/xeround_mysql_database_service/ "Xeround reinvents MySQL atop Amazon cloud"], ''[http://www.theregister.co.uk The Register]'', Retrieved 25-8-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The beta version of the service was reported to be used by 2000 organizations;&lt;ref name="computerworld"&gt;James Niccolai, [http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/391370/four_companies_rethink_databases_cloud "Four companies rethink databases for the cloud"], ''[http://www.computerworld.com.au Computerworld.com.au]'', Retrieved 12-9-2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="devshed"&gt;[http://www.devshed.com/c/a/MySQL/Xeround-Announces-Cloud-Service-for-MySQL/ "Xeround Announces Cloud Service for MySQL"], ''[http://www.devshed.com DevShed.com]'', Retrieved 25-8-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gigaom2"&gt;Derrick Harris, [http://gigaom.com/cloud/xeround-enters-ga-tests-the-sql-in-the-cloud-water/ "Xeround enters GA, tests the SQL-in-the-cloud water], ''[http://www.gigaom.com GigaOM]'', Retrieved 25-8-2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Deutcher, [http://siliconangle.com/blog/2011/06/13/xeround-releases-cloud-service-for-mysql-applications/ "Xeround Releases Cloud Service for MySQL Applications"], ''[http://siliconangle.com Silicon Angle]'', Retrieved 15-9-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; General Availability was announced in June 2011.&lt;ref name="database-journal"&gt;Sean Michael Kerner, [http://www.databasejournal.com/news/xeround-mysql-cloud-database-ga.html "Xeround MySQL Cloud Database Goes GA"], ''[http://www.databasejournal.com Database Journal]'', Retrieved 25-8-2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to CNET blogger Dave Rosenberg, Xeround's MySQL support makes it "well positioned to take a leadership position in the database market".&lt;ref&gt;Dave Rosenberg, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13846_3-20016428-62.html Xeround scales MySQL for the cloud], ''[http://news.cnet.com CNET]'', Retrieved 25-8-2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

On May 1, 2013 Xeround announced to its paid customers that they were shutting down the Cloud Database Service and all data must be migrated before being dropped on May 15, 2013&lt;ref&gt;http://xeround.com/blog/2013/05/discontinuing-of-xeround-cloud-database-public-service&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product==
Xeround provides a cloud database service for applications based on the [[open source]] edition of the MySQL database&lt;ref name="register" /&gt; (MySQL is currently owned by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]). The product addresses two related problems: it is complex to run databases on the cloud, especially if high availability is needed; and databases in general are difficult to scale, as data throughput and volumes grow.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Rosenberg, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13846_3-20022794-62.html, Are databases in the cloud really all that different?], ''[http://news.cnet.com CNET]'', Retrieved 8-9-2011&lt;/ref&gt; A cloud database service solves both problems, by managing the database on the cloud and taking care of scalability and high availability, in a way that is transparent to the application.&lt;ref name="register" /&gt; Instead of connecting to a local instance of MySQL, applications can connect to Xeround's cloud database, and are then free to scale as needed. Because Xeround is an in-memory distributed database, it is currently limited up to 50 Gigabytes of data.&lt;ref name="xeround-pricing-blog"&gt;Razi Sharir, [http://xeround.com/blog/2011/07/xeround-pay-per-use-pricing-explained "Xeround Pay-Per-Use Pricing Explained"], ''[http://xeround.com Xeround.com]'', Retrieved 18-9-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Xeround gives a no downtime SLA guarantee [http://xeround.com/mysql-cloud-db-overview/mysql-high-availability/]. The service offers pay-per-use pricing, calculated per Gigabyte per hour, with an additional charge for data transfer for large databases.&lt;ref name="pricing"&gt;[http://xeround.com/mysql-cloud-db-overview/pay-per-use-cloud-database/ "Xeround Pricing"], ''[http://xeround.com Xeround.com]'', Retrieved 15-9-2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

Xeround offers its service on several cloud platforms - as of September 2011, Xeround supported [[Amazon EC2]],&lt;ref name="database-journal" /&gt; [[RackSpace]],&lt;ref name="rackspace"&gt;Angela Bartels, [http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/blog/2011/04/12/xeround-provides-auto-scaling-high-availability-for-your-mysql-database-in-the-cloud/ "Xeround Provides Auto-Scaling &amp; High-Availability for your MySQL Database in the Cloud"], ''[http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/blog/ RackSpace Cloud Blog]'', Retrieved 25-8-2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heroku]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/xeround "Xeround Cloud Database for MySQL applications"], ''[http://devcenter.heroku.com Heroku Dev Center]'', Retrieved 25-8-2011&lt;/ref&gt; and is planning to support additional providers.&lt;ref name="database-journal" /&gt; As of March 2011, Xeround was the only commercially available product which supports more than one cloud provider, allowing users to move their databases freely between cloud platforms without being locked in.&lt;ref name="gigaom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zdnet"&gt;Dan Kusnetzky, [http://www.zdnet.com/blog/virtualization/xeround-add-on-for-heroku-cloud-platform/2920 "Xeround Add-on for Heroku Cloud Platform"], ''[http://www.zdnet.com ZDNet]'', Retrieved 25-8-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While Xeround uses the open source version of MySQL, the cloud database software itself is not open source. Another distinction is that while Xeround offers MySQL as a front-end, on the back-end it is a [[NoSQL]] data storage system distributed on a large number of physical nodes - so it is not subject to the scalability limitations of regular MySQL databases.&lt;ref name="zdnet" /&gt;

On 1 May 2013 Xeround announced via an e-mail to customers that they would no longer be providing their service. The service is to end on 15 May 2013.

==Competitors and alternatives==
Xeround's primary competitors are database services offered by the large cloud vendors, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] [[Amazon Relational Database Service|Relational Database Service]] and [[Database.com]] by [[SalesForce]].&lt;ref name="gigaom" /&gt; Other cloud database providers mentioned by industry sources&lt;ref name="computerworld" /&gt;&lt;ref name="readwriteweb"&gt;Klint Finley, [http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/01/7-cloud-based-database-service.php "7 Cloud-Based Database Services"], ''[http://www.readwriteweb.com ReadWriteWeb]'', Retrieved 18-9-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; are [[Microsoft Azure]] SQL Database, [[ScaleDB]], NimbusDB, ClearDB, ParAccel, as well as NoSQL key-value data stores such as [[Amazon SimpleDB]], [[Google AppEngine]] Data Store, [[Couchbase Server]], and [[Cloudant]]. 

Database users running their applications on the cloud also have the option of installing databases in a "do it yourself" manner instead of paying for a cloud database service. This involves purchasing a machine instance on a cloud computing platform like Amazon EC2, and manually installing a database. This method is considered to be less expensive, but more complex, than using an "out of the box" database service like Xeround.&lt;ref name="diy"&gt;[http://xeround.com/cloud-database-comparison/ "Cloud Database: Do-It-Yourself or Database-as-a-Service?"], [http://xeround.com Xeround.com], Retrieved 15-9-2011&lt;/ref&gt;
