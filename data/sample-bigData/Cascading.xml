'''Cascading''' is a software abstraction layer for [[Apache Hadoop]].  Cascading is used to create and execute complex data processing workflows on a Hadoop cluster using any [[JVM]]-based language ([[Java]], [[JRuby]], [[Clojure]], etc.), hiding the underlying complexity of [[MapReduce]] jobs.  It is open source and available under the [[Apache License]]. Commercial support is available from Concurrent, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cascading.org/support Cascading support page]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cascading was originally authored by Chris Wensel, who later founded Concurrent, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concurrentinc.com Concurrent, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; Cascading is being actively developed by the community and a number of add-on modules are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cascading.org/modules.html Cascading modules]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
To use Cascading, Apache Hadoop must also be installed, and the Hadoop job .jar must contain the Cascading .jars. Cascading consists of a data processing API, integration API, process planner and process scheduler.  

Cascading leverages the scalability of Hadoop but abstracts standard data processing operations away from underlying map and reduce tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2010/02/24/analyzing-etsys-data-with-hadoop-and-cascading/  Blog post by Etsy describing their use of Cascading with Hadoop]&lt;/ref&gt;  Developers use Cascading to create a .jar file that describes the required processes. It follows a ‘source-pipe-sink’ paradigm, where data is captured from sources, follows reusable ‘pipes’ that perform data analysis processes, where the results are stored in output files or ‘sinks’. Pipes are created independent from the data they will process. Once tied to data sources and sinks, it is called a ‘flow’. These flows can be grouped into a ‘cascade’, and the process scheduler will ensure a given flow does not execute until all its dependencies are satisfied. Pipes and flows can be reused and reordered to support different business needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cascading.org/1.2/userguide/pdf/userguide.pdf Cascading User Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Developers write the code in a JVM-based language and do not need to learn MapReduce. The resulting program can be regression tested and integrated with external applications like any other Java application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concurrentinc.com/products/ Concurrent product page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cascading is most often used for ad targeting, log file analysis, bioinformatics, machine learning, predictive analytics, web content mining, and extract, transform and load (ETL) applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concurrentinc.com/ Concurrent home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of Cascading==
Cascading is cited as one of the top five most powerful Hadoop projects by SD Times in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdtimes.com/l/35596 Handy, Alex, “The top five most powerful Hadoop projects,” SD Times, June 1, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; as a major open source project relevant to bioinformatics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/S12/S1 Taylor, Ronald C, “An overview of the Hadoop/MapReduce/HBase framework and its current applications in bioinformatics,” Proceedings of the 11th Annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) 2010, Dec. 21, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; and is included in Hadoop: A Definitive Guide, by Tom White.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Nff49D7vnJcC&amp;lpg=PA539&amp;dq=cascading%20hadoop&amp;pg=PA548#v=onepage&amp;q=cascading%20hadoop&amp;f=false White, Tom, “Hadoop: The Definitive Guide,” O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2010, pp. 539 – 549.]&lt;/ref&gt; The project is also widely cited in presentations, conference proceedings and Hadoop user group meetings as a useful tool for working with Hadoop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/pacoid/getting-started-on-hadoop Nathan, Paco (Wikipedia: [[Paco Nathan]]), “Getting Started on Hadoop” presentation for the SV Cloud Computing Meetup, 7/19/2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartfrog.org/wiki/download/attachments/6193590/hadoop_and_beyond.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1238073739000 Julio Guijarro, Steve Loughran and Paolo Castagna, “Hadoop and beyond,” HP Labs, Bristol UK, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/hadoopusergroup/flightcaster-presentation-hadoop Cross, Bradford, “Flightcaster_HUG,” Presentation at the Bay Area Hadoop Users’ Group, March 26, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/chriscurtin/nosql-hadoop-cascading-june-2010?from=ss_embed Curtin, Christopher, “NoSQL, Hadoop and Cascading,” June 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;
