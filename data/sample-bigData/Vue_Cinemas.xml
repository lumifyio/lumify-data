'''Vue Entertainment''' (stylised as '''vue'''), formerly '''SBC International Cinemas''', is a [[Movie theater|cinema]] company operating in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The company was formed in May 2003 by the acquisition of [[Warner Village Cinemas]] by SBC and the subsequent rebranding of the business as Vue. As of 2013 the company has 80 cinemas in the UK, making it the second largest cinema chain in the country, with 755 screens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myvue.com/about-us About Vue Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; The company's flagship site is the former Warner Village cinema in [[Leicester Square]].

The company expanded through a number of acquisitions, including the [[Ster Century]] chain, Apollo cinemas and [[Multikino]]. In June 2006, Vue's executive team completed a management buy-out with the backing of [[Bank of Scotland]] Corporate,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claritypartners.net/news/062006.html Clarity Partners: Vue Entertainment Announces Management Buyout]&lt;/ref&gt; taking a 51% stake in the business and buying the four remaining Warner Village sites it had been operating under contract from [[Village Roadshow]]. The company was bought by the private equity firm [[Doughty Hanson &amp; Co]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/03cb7ab6-eab1-11df-b28d-00144feab49a.html#axzz20SlINuoq Doughty Hanson buys Vue cinemas]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Doughty Hanson &amp; Co announced the sale of the company to the Canadian firms [[OMERS]] and [[Alberta Investment Management Corporation]] for £935 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vue Cinemas sold in £935m deal |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22841346 |newspaper=BBC News |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Leeds Light VUE.jpg|thumb|right|Vue at [[The Light (Leeds)|The Light]] in [[Leeds]]]]
The company was formed in 2003 when SBC bought Warner Village Cinemas from [[Warner Brothers]] for £250 million. At the time, SBC owned four cinemas, and Warner Village Cinemas owned 36.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deal marks the end for Warner Village |author=Richard Wray |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2003/may/14/film.filmnews |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 May 2003 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005 the chain acquired the [[Ster Century]] chain from Aurora Entertainment; this included the highest grossing cinema in the UK or Ireland at [[Liffey Valley Shopping Centre]] in [[Dublin]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vue Entertainment Purchases Ster Century UK &amp; Ireland |url=http://www.bvlp.com/press-announcements-events/vue-entertainment-purchases-ster-century-uk-ireland/ |publisher=BV Investment Partners |date=April 2005 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 20 June 2006, Vue's executive team completed a management buy-out of the company with the backing of Bank Of Scotland Corporate; the management team retaining a 51% stake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claritypartners.net/news/062006.html Clarity Partners: Vue Entertainment Announces Management Buyout]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as part of the buy-out, Vue took full ownership of the four Village sites it had been operating under contract from Village Roadshow. The private equity firm [[Doughty Hanson &amp; Co]] acquired Vue in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/03cb7ab6-eab1-11df-b28d-00144feab49a.html#axzz20SlINuoq Doughty Hanson buys Vue cinemas]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vue bought the company Apollo in 2012, retaining 14 new sites across the UK, making it the second largest Cinema Company in the UK behind Odeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ee2be098-9ac1-11e1-94d7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2VqJcz9t7 |title=Vue acquires rival Apollo for £20m |date=10 May 2012 |publisher=Financial Times |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Vue Entertainment acquired [[Multikino]], the Polish cinema operator owning 30 cinemas with almost 250 screens in Poland and Baltic countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/uks-vue-entertainment-buys-polish-152510033.html#ahflkasjhdflakd Vue Entertainment buys Polish Multikino]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Doughty Hanson &amp; Co announced the sale of the company to the Canadian firms [[OMERS]] and [[Alberta Investment Management Corporation]] for £935 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vue Cinemas sold in £935m deal |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22841346 |newspaper=BBC News |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
Vue's multiplexes vary in size from 4 to 30 screens and as a result the staffing of each site is slightly different. Each cinema is run by the management team. This team will consist of one general manager (GM) assisted by between 2 and 5 other members of the management team, depending on the size and complexity of the site. The general manager has general control of the running of the cinema at site level, while assisted by the other members of the management team. Team Leaders act as duty managers and are responsible for the operational running of a cinema on a shift basis. Customer Assistants serve guests throughout the cinema and report to the management team.

In addition to this, all cinemas have a dedicated projection team, responsible for the running of the "box" and the maintenance of the projection and sound equipment. The projection department is structured much like the rest of the cinema. The Technical Manager has overall responsibility, supported by a Senior Projectionist. They are accompanied by a team of 2 to 4 full or part-time projection staff, some of which can also share duties with the standard operation of the cinema. However, all Vue sites are now fully digital, and therefore ran by the management team, or Technical Manager.

Vue completed the rollout of the [[Vista Entertainment Solutions]] integrated Point of Sale software to every site in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vista.co.nz/awm/index.php?page=OC_CS_VEX Vista Case Study: Vue Entertainment]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this the majority of Vue cinemas ran the WaBITS ticketing system, developed in-house in London by Warner Bros. International Cinemas. This was an internal system used in all former Warner Village cinemas until 2007, when the division responsible for development was closed owing to the sale of the remaining joint venture cinema chains. WaBTIS continues to be used in Japan by Warner Mycal Cinemas who now own the rights to the system.  

The new system enables customers to buy tickets at any retail point in the cinema, as well as online through the company website.  Vue were the first major cinema operator in the UK to implement this "single point of sale" concept. Some cinemas (including those in [[Aberdeen]], [[Birkenhead]], [[Camberley]], [[Cardiff]], [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], [[Cwmbran]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] [[Princes Quay]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[The Light (Leeds)|The Leeds Light]], [[Hartlepool]], [[Merthyr Tydfil]], [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], [[Northampton]] and [[Swansea]]) have no dedicated box office, meaning that all transactions are carried out at retail stands.
