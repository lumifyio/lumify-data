'''10gen''' is a software company that develops and provides commercial support for the open source database [[MongoDB]], a [[NoSQL]] database that stores data in [[JSON]]-like documents with flexible schemas.

==History==

10gen was founded in 2007 by former [[DoubleClick]] founder and CTO [[Dwight Merriman]] and former DoubleClick CEO and [[Gilt Groupe]] founder [[Kevin P. Ryan]] with former Doubleclick engineer and [[ShopWiki]] founder and CTO [[Eliot Horowitz]]. 10gen has received $81 million in venture capital funding from [[Flybridge Capital Partners]], [[In-Q-Tel]], [[Intel]], [[New Enterprise Associates]] (NEA), [[Red Hat]], [[Sequoia Capital]], and [[Fred Wilson (financier)|Union Square Ventures]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crainsnewyork.com/gallery/20130225/TECHNOLOGY/225009999/9 NYC's Largest Venture Capital Deals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crunchbase.com/company/10gen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/10gen-raises-42-million-financing-round-led-by-new-enterprise-associates-2012-05-29, WSJ, MarketWatch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gigaom.com/cloud/with-42m-more-10gen-wants-to-take-mongodb-mainstream/, GigaOm&lt;/ref&gt;

The company originally aimed to build a [[platform as a service]] similar to [[Google App Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/25/the_once_and_future_mongodb/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the company decided to open source the database component, [[MongoDB]] as a stand-alone product.&lt;ref name="release"&gt;[http://blog.mongodb.org/post/434865639/state-of-mongodb-march-2010 MongoDB Blog - March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company currently has offices in New York, Palo Alto, Reston, London, Dublin, Barcelona and Sydney.&lt;ref name="10gen.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/12/sequoia-leads-20-million-round-in-mongodb-big-data-database-provider-10gen/ Sequoia Leads $20 Million Round In MongoDB Big Data Database Provider 10gen]&lt;/ref&gt; 10gen was founded in New York City and opened its first west coast office in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/10gen-Announces-Key-Hires-in-Engineering-and-Sales-1303938.htm 10gen Announces Key Hires in Engineering and Sales]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, 10gen moved into the [[New York Times Building (41 Park Row)|old New York Times building]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://commercialobserver.com/2012/12/tech-firm-10gen-plants-a-flag-in-the-old-new-york-times-building/ Commercial Observer]&lt;/ref&gt;
