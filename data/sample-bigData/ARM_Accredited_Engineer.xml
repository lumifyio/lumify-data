'''ARM Accredited Engineer (AAE)''' is a program of [[Professional certification (computer technology)|professional certifications]] awarded by [[ARM Holdings]].  The AAE program is designed for computer software and hardware engineers wishing to validate their knowledge of ARM technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARM Accredited Engineer Program|url=http://www.arm.com/support/arm-accredited-engineer/index.php|work=ARM public website|publisher=ARM Holdings|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was launched in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Peter|title=ARM to intro engineer certification|url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4390950/ARM-engineer-exam|work=EE Times website|publisher=EE Times|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manners|first=David|title=ARM to launch Accredited Engineer programme at TechCon|url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/12/10/2012/54765/arm-to-launch-accredited-engineer-programme-at-techcon.htm|work=Electronics Weekly website|publisher=Electronics Weekly|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a series of events including ARM TechCon 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abreu|first=David|title=Crowds Flock to ARM Accredited Engineer Training... and Ask Questions|url=http://blogs.arm.com/soc-design/845-crowds-flock-to-arm-accredited-engineer-training-and-ask-questions/|work=ARM Blog|publisher=ARM Holdings|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James Alan|first=Miller|title=IT News Today: ARM Engineer Program Certification, CA Automation Suite for Data Centers, Big Data Drives $28 Billion of IT Spending|url=http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/big_data-cloud_computing-server_automation-SoC-ARM_accredited_Engineer,2-388-2.html|work=Tom's IT Pro website|publisher=Tom's IT Pro|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Peter|title=Crowds flock to ARM engineer training|url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4400225/Crowds-flock-to-ARM-engineer-training|work=EE Times website|publisher=EE Times|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAE program consists of a number of certifications, each with their own [[syllabus]], and each assessed by means of a separate one hour multiple-choice [[exam]].

== Certifications ==
Only one certification, ARM Accredited Engineer (AAE), is currently available. Others will be launched over the next few years.

=== ARM Accredited Engineer (AAE) ===
AAE, an entry-level certification, was the first to be launched. The AAE syllabus covers software-related aspects of the ARMv7 Architecture, with a specific focus on [[Cortex-A]] and [[Cortex-R]] profiles, including applications processors and real-time processors. The syllabus does not cover [[Cortex-M]] systems. The AAE certification is aimed at general embedded software and systems developers who have a broad knowledge of ARM technology.

The syllabus covers the following subject areas:

* ARM architecture (30%)
* Software development (30%)
* Software optimization (15%)
* System (10%)
* Software debug (8%)
* Implementation (7%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARM Accredited Engineer Certification|url=http://www.arm.com/support/arm-accredited-engineer/certifications/arm-accredited-engineer-certification.php|work=ARM public website|publisher=ARM Holdings|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ARM Accredited MCU Engineer (AAME) ===
The AAME certification will be launched in 2013. It is intended to be an entry-level certification, similar to the basic AAE certification, but focused on the ARMv7 [[Cortex-M]] profile. This certification is aimed at general embedded software engineers with a broad knowledge of ARM technology, with a bias toward [[microcontroller]]s.

=== Other certifications ===
The following certifications are being considered for launch between 2013 and 2016:
* ARM Accredited Cortex-A Engineer (AACAE)
* ARM Accredited Cortex-R Engineer (AACRE)
* AA Windows on ARM Developer (AAWoAD)
* AA Linux on ARM Developer (AALoAD)
* AA Android on ARM Developer (AAAoAD)
* AA Graphics Specialist (AAGS)
* AA Security Specialist (AASS)
* ARM Accredited Cortex-M Engineer  (AACME)
* ARM Accredited SoC Developer (AASoCD)
* ARM Accredited SoC Specialist (AASoCS)

== Exams ==
AAE program exams can be taken at any one of 6000 Authorized [[Prometric]] Test Centers (APTCs) worldwide, as a [[Computer-based testing|computer-based test]] on a dedicated test platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prometric Signs Contract for International Software Engineer Certification Programme|url=https://www.prometric.com/en-us/news-and-resources/press-releases/Pages/Prometric-Signs-Contract-for-International-Software-Engineer-Certification-Programme-htm.aspx|work=Prometric website|publisher=Prometric|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 70 multiple choice questions. Candidates are given one hour to complete the test. Results are issued instantly on-screen.  Grades are either pass or fail - no letter or percentage grades are issued. On passing the exam, candidates can also request a paper certificate to be mailed to them.
