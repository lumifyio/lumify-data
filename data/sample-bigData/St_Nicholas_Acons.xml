'''St Nicholas Acons'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surnamedb.com/surname.aspx?name=Hassey On occasion spelt Acorns]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Anglican]] parish church, dating back to the 9th century(Youngs,1979) and situated in Nicholas Lane(Hallows,1954) within the [[City of London]], which was destroyed during the [[Great Fire of London]] and not rebuilt(Reynolds,1922). Its parish book, however, did survive and records that a foundling discovered in 1539 was named Nicholas Acons(Brigg,1890), the name itself stemming from a mediaeval benefactor(Stow,1890). The parish was united with [[St Edmund the King and Martyr]], Lombard Street in 1670.(Hibbert) The name was  retained as a [[precinct]] title &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=20221&amp;strquery British History On-line]&lt;/ref&gt; in the south-western part of  [[Langbourn|Langbourn Ward]], one of the 25 self-governing [[Wards of the City of London|wards]], and featured in a famous 18th century court case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/luceneweb/bailey/highlight.jsp?ref=t17991030-26&amp;words=St%20AND%20Nicholas%20AND%20Acorn#firsthil Old Bailey Case]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s a proposed unification of benefices between St Edmunds with St Nicholas and [[St Mary Woolnoth]] with St Mary Woolchurch Haw(Times 1861) was vigorously defended by St N.A.’s&lt;ref&gt;A Fire plaque in nearby St Nicholas Passage reads E &amp; S Poynder St N.A. 1836&lt;/ref&gt; discrete churchwardens.&lt;ref&gt;On appeal from the Arches Court of Canterbury.
