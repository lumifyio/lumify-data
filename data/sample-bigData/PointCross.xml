==History ==
PointCross was founded in 1999.  Headquartered in [[Foster City, California]], the company also has offices in [[Texas]], [[France]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="PC"/&gt; Suresh Madhavan serves as PointCross’s CEO. The company got its start by servicing the oil and gas industry, including companies like [[BP]], [[Halliburton]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]].&lt;ref name="IT"/&gt;

In December 2006, PointCross acquired PharmQuest, a software company focused in the pre-clinical area of drug development.&lt;ref name="IT"/&gt; In 2011, the company introduced its solutions for bigdata analytics for weakly structured data related to Pharma nonclinical studies and clinical trials. The company combined its earlier work in secure enterprise search technology with bigdata analytics to provide research and decision support tools for Pharma and Upstream Oil and Gas.&lt;ref name="PC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FPM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IT"/&gt;

In 2012, the company announced its seismic data technology, which stores and manages data sets across an entire company.&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt;

The company also announced the release of its drug safety and information management suite in response to the U.S. FDA’s announcement that Pharma companies would be required to include all nonclinical study data in electronic format. The software allows researchers and the FDA to sort through and study nonclinical data during the research and development process.&lt;ref name="IP"&gt;{{ cite web |url= | title= India Pharma News | author= | date= March 2012| publisher= India Pharma | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orchestra==
Orchestra provides an ontological organization of business information. The software allows the sharing information across a business's global infrastructure.&lt;ref name="IT"/&gt; It also provides toolkits that allow users to interact with each other.&lt;ref name="IT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{ cite web |url= http://www.pointcross.com/products/cross-industry-solutions-orchestra.html| title= Orchestra™ Ontology Engine| author= | date= | publisher= PointCross| accessdate= September 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orchestra’s desktop companion product, Solo, is an offline, synchronizing client for [[Server (computing)|server]] applications. Solo keeps all data encrypted while users perform tasks in common [[computer applications]] such as [[Microsoft Outlook]] or [[Microsoft Office]].&lt;ref name="O"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{ cite web |url= | title= AsiaPulse News | author= | date= Sept 7 2007| publisher= AsiaPulse | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solo allows users to work offline from the main network, synchronizing the new data (such as new [[emails]]) the next time the user connects to the [[Computer network|network]].&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;{{ cite web |url= https://orchestra.pointcross.com/orchestraWeb/english/OrchLogin.asp | title= OrchestraTM  Version 3.2.5.363| author= | date= | publisher= PointCross | accessdate= September 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
