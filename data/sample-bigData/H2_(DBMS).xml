'''H2''' is a [[relational database management system]] written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It can be embedded in Java applications or run in the client-server mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Presentation and use of H2 Database Engine | url=http://www.baptiste-wicht.com/2010/08/presentation-usage-h2-database-engine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disk footprint (size of the [[JAR (file format)|jar file]]) is about 1.5 MB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jar File Download |  url=http://www.h2database.com/html/features.html |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software is available as [[open source]] software under modified versions of the [[Mozilla Public License]] or the original [[Eclipse Public License]]. The modification of the MPL is a shorter file header and the license name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=OpenLogic Exchange Package Listing | url=http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/h2database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main features ==
A subset of the [[SQL]] (Structured Query Language) standard is supported. The main programming APIs are [[SQL]] and [[JDBC]], however the database also supports using the [[PostgreSQL]] [[ODBC]] driver by acting like a [[PostgreSQL]] server. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=H2 Database supports PostgreSQL ODBC driver | url=http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=46456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to create both in-memory tables, as well as disk-based tables. Tables can be persistent or temporary. Index types are hash table and tree for in-memory tables, and [[b-tree]] for disk-based tables. All data manipulation operations are [[Database transaction|transactional]]. Table level locking and [[multiversion concurrency control]] are implemented. The [[2-phase commit]] protocol is supported as well, but no standard API for distributed transactions is implemented. The security features of the database are: [[Access control#Role-based access control|role based]] access rights, encryption of the password using [[SHA-256]] and data using the [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] or the Tiny Encryption Algorithm, [[XTEA]]. The cryptographic features are available as functions inside the database as well. [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] / [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] connections are supported in the client-server mode, as well as when using the console application.

Two [[full text search]] implementations are included, a native implementation and one using [[Lucene]].

A simple form of high availability is implemented: when used in the client-server mode, the database engine supports hot failover (this is commonly known as clustering). However, the clustering mode must be enabled manually after a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=H2 Clustering | url=http://geowebcache.org/trac/wiki/external_h2db#H2clustering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The database supports protection against [[SQL injection]] by enforcing the use of parameterized statements. In H2, this feature is called 'disabling literals'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SQL Injections: How Not To Get Stuck | url=http://thecodist.com/article/sql-injections-how-not-to-get}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since version 1.1.111, H2 [[in-memory database]] can run inside the [[Google App Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=H2 Database on GAE | publisher=gaevfs | url=http://code.google.com/p/gaevfs/wiki/H2GAE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Durability problems==

H2 documentation describes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h2database.com/html/advanced.html#durability_problems] {{ref-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; problems with [[Durability_(database_systems)|durability]] (part of [[ACID]]), which can cause [[Data_loss|data loss]] of [[Database_transaction|committed transactions]] in case of a [[Power_outage|power failure]].&lt;br/&gt;
According to documentation, the system doesn't call any FileDescriptor.sync () not FileChannel.force () not [[Sync_(Unix)|fsync]] because they significantly degrades system performance: only 60 [[IOPS|write operations per second]] are achievable.&lt;br/&gt;
Another reason not using fsync that many HDD has [[Disk_buffer|write caching]] enabled by factory default.&lt;br/&gt;
The documentation advised to use additional commands '''SET WRITE_DELAY''' and '''CHECKPOINT SYNC''' to ensure durability, which are available as an administrator only.

== Utilities ==

An embedded [[web server]] with a browser based console application are included, as well as command line tools to start and stop a server, backup and restore databases, and a command line shell tool.

== History ==

The development of the H2 database engine started in May 2004, but it was first published in December 2005. The database engine is written by Thomas Mueller. He also developed the Java database engine Hypersonic SQL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsql.sourceforge.net/index.html Hypersonic SQL project page] at [[SourceForge]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Hypersonic SQL project was stopped, and the [[HSQLDB]] Group was formed to continue work on the Hypersonic SQL code. The name H2 stands for Hypersonic 2, however H2 does not share code with Hypersonic SQL or HSQLDB. H2 is built from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Write Your Own Database, Again | publisher=http://thecodist.com | url=http://thecodist.com/article/write-your-own-database-again-an-interview-with-the-author-of-h2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
