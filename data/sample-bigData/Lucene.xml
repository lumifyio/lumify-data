'''Apache Lucene''' is a [[free software|free]]/[[open source software|open source]] [[information retrieval]] [[Library (computing)|software library]], originally created in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] by [[Doug Cutting]]. It is supported by the [[Apache Software Foundation]] and is released under the [[Apache Software License]].

Lucene has been ported to other programming languages including [[Object Pascal|Delphi]], [[Perl]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[C++]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and [[PHP]].&lt;ref name="port"&gt;[http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneImplementations Lucene implementations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Doug Cutting]] originally wrote Lucene in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://trijug.org/downloads/TriJug-11-07.pdf |title=Better Search with Apache Lucene and Solr |date=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially available for download from its home at the [[SourceForge]] web site. It joined the Apache Software Foundation's [[Jakarta Project|Jakarta]] family of open-source Java products in September 2001 and became its own top-level Apache project in February 2005. Until recently,{{When?|date=August 2012}} it included a number of sub-projects, such as [[Lucene.net|Lucene.NET]], [[Apache Mahout|Mahout]], [[Solr]] and [[Nutch]]. Solr has merged into the Lucene project itself and Mahout, Nutch, and Tika have moved to become independent top-level projects.

==Features and common use==
While suitable for any application which requires full text [[Index (search engine)|indexing]] and searching capability, Lucene has been widely recognized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lucene in Action, Second Edition |last1= McCandless |first1=Michael |last2=Hatcher |first2=Erik |last3=GospodnetiÄ‡ |first3=Otis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Manning  |location= |isbn=1933988177 |page=8 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glscube.org/downloads/glscube_design.pdf GNU/Linux Semantic Storage System]&lt;/ref&gt; for its utility in the implementation of [[Internet search engine]]s and local, single-site searching.

At the core of Lucene's logical architecture is the idea of a '''document''' containing '''fields''' of text. This flexibility allows Lucene's API to be independent of the [[file format]]. Text from [[Portable Document Format|PDFs]], [[HTML]], [[Microsoft Word]], and [[OpenDocument]] documents, as well as many others (except images), can all be indexed as long as their textual information can be extracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition: 5th International Conference |last=Perner |first=Petra |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |location= |isbn=978-3-540-73498-7 |page=387 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lucene-based projects==
Lucene itself is just an indexing and search library and does not contain [[web spider|crawling]] and HTML [[parsers|parsing]] functionality. However, several projects extend Lucene's capability:
* Apache [[Nutch]] &amp;mdash; provides web crawling and HTML parsing
* Apache [[Solr]] &amp;mdash; an enterprise search server
* [[ElasticSearch]] &amp;mdash; an enterprise search server
* [[Compass Project|Compass]] &amp;mdash; a [[Java Search Engine Framework]]
* [[DocFetcher]] &amp;mdash; a [[multiplatform]] desktop search application

===Lucene.NET===

Lucene.NET is a port of Lucene written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and targeted at [[.NET Framework]] users. There are currently two variations of the software, differing in Generics support and a few bug fixes.  The version that supports Generics has a lowercase "g" appended to the version name to distinguish between the two.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Regardless of generics support, all versions of Lucene.NET (with or without the "g") should be able to read and write index files from the corresponding version of Java Lucene with no issues.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Users==

For a list of companies that use Lucene (rather than extend), see Lucene's "Powered By" page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/PoweredBy PoweredBy]&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, Twitter is using Lucene for its real time search.&lt;ref name="twitter"&gt;[http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/new-twitter-search/ Twitter uses Lucene]&lt;/ref&gt;
