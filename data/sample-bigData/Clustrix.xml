'''Clustrix, Inc.''' is a San Francisco-based company that develops a [[NewSQL]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.the451group.com/information_management/2011/04/06/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-newsql/ What we talk about when we talk about NewSQL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/04/the-newsql-movement.php The NewSQL Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; Database.  The company was founded by Paul Mikesell (formerly of [[EMC Isilon]]) and Sergei Tsarev (developer of Simple Time-series Database) and is headed by Robin Purohit (formerly of [[HP]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clustrix.com/company/about-us/management/ Clustrix Management Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; The company is privately held, and is backed by [[Sequoia Capital]], [[U.S. Venture Partners]] (USVP), and ATA Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/clustrix-delivers-scale-out-sql-dbaas-for-big-data-applications-with-new-cloud-economics-2012-07-18 Marketwatch Article on Clustrix]&lt;/ref&gt; Clustrix is a distributed primary SQL database.

== Market ==

Clustrix is a [[Scalability#Scale horizontally vs. vertically|scale-out]] SQL database and part of what are often called the [[NewSQL]] databases (modern [[Relational database management system|relational]] [[database management system]]s), which have started to gain mind share &lt;ref&gt;[http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/9/24/google-spanners-most-surprising-revelation-nosql-is-out-and.html / Google Spanner's most surprising revelation NoSQL is Out and NewSQL is in]&lt;/ref&gt; closely following the [[NoSQL]] movement. 

Clustrix is a mature product, based on support for stored procedures and that it was designed and built before competitive NewSQL databases.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The product launched in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;http://venturebeat.com/2010/05/03/y-combinators-clustrix-rolls-out-databases-that-scale/&lt;/ref&gt; and has served customers since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dbms2.com/2010/05/12/the-clustrix-story/&lt;/ref&gt; The primary databases like [[Microsoft SQL Server]] and MySQL supported [[online transaction processing]] and [[online analytical processing]] but were not distributed. Clustrix occupies this space with a distributed SQL, [[ACID]] database that scales transactions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insideanalysis.com/2013/01/companies-technologies-to-watch-in-2013/&lt;/ref&gt; and support real-time analytics. Other successful distributed SQL databases are [[Column-oriented DBMS|columnar]] (they don't support primary transaction workload) and focus on offline analytics and this includes [[EMC Greenplum]], [[HP Vertica]], [[Infobright]], and [[Amazon Redshift]]. Notable players in the primary SQL database space are [[In-memory database|in-memory]]. This includes [[VoltDB]] and [[MemSQL]], which excel at low-latency transactions, but do not target real-time analytics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} NoSQL competitors, like [[MongoDB]] are good at handling unstructured data and read heavy workloads, but do no compete in the space for write heavy workloads (no transactions, coarse grained (DB-level) [[Lock (database)|locking]], and no SQL features (like [[Join (SQL)|joins]]), so the NewSQL and NoSQL databases are complimentary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Products ==

Clustrix is a primary scale-out SQL database. It supports workloads that involve scaling transactions and real-time analytics. The system is a drop-in replacement for [[MySQL]], and is designed to overcome MySQL scalability issues with a minimum of disruption to an enterprise's production activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/external/gigaom/2011/01/17/17gigaom-clustrix-lifts-the-curtain-on-early-database-cust-93427.html?adxnnl=1&amp;partner=&amp;adxnnlx=1295460060-+Q1NmQDKXNGYjDWtdfSQIA&lt;/ref&gt; It also has built in fault-tolerance features for high availability within a cluster. It has parallel backup and parallel replication among clusters for disaster recovery.

Clustrix's database is available as software in [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS) Limited Preview,&lt;ref&gt;http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/19/your-database-is-probably-terrible/&lt;/ref&gt; as a vertically integrated appliance for on-premise or colocation and DBaaS,&lt;ref&gt;http://finance.yahoo.com/news/clustrix-delivers-scale-sql-dbaas-120000541.html&lt;/ref&gt; through public cloud partners like [[Rackspace]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rackspace.com/blog/clustrix-the-leader-in-newsql-databases/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Equinix.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clustrix.com/company/news-events/press-releases/?month=10&amp;year=2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Clustrix database appliance is a cluster of 1U servers, each housing seven SSD drives, one spinning disk, dual processors, 48GB of RAM, and an infiniband connection for communications between servers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clustrix.com/products/delivered-as-an-appliance/ Clustrix Product Page]&lt;/ref&gt;   The minimum configuration includes three 1U servers and provides one server worth of redundancy so that a failed server does not bring down the database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2010/05/03/clustrix-builds-the-webscale-holy-grail-a-database-that-scales/ GigaOm Article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/cloud/facebook-trapped-in-mysql-fate-worse-than-death/ Facebook trapped in MySQL ‘fate worse than death’]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

=== Query evaluation ===
The Clustrix database operates on a distributed cluster of [[Shared nothing architecture|shared-nothing]] nodes using a [[NewSQL#Systems|query to data]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clustrix.com/Portals/146389/docs/clustrix_a_new_approach.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Here nodes typically own a subset of the data. SQL queries are split into query fragments and sent to the nodes that own the data. This enables Clustrix to [[Scalability#Scale horizontally vs. vertically|scale horizontally]] ([[Scalability#Scale horizontally vs. vertically|scale out]]) as additional nodes are added.&lt;ref&gt;http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/19/your-database-is-probably-terrible/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data distribution ===
The Clustrix database automatically splits and distributes data evenly across nodes with each slice having copies on other nodes.&lt;ref&gt;http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs227/slides/checkpointing/clustrix.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Uniform data distribution is maintained as nodes are added, removed or if data is inserted unevenly. This automatic data distribution approach removes the need to [[Shard (database architecture)|shard]] and enables Clustrix to maintain [[database#Availability|database availability]] in the face of node loss.&lt;ref&gt;http://cattell.net/datastores/Datastores.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance ==
In a performance test completed by [[Percona]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clustrix.com/Default.aspx?app=LeadgenDownload&amp;shortpath=docs%2fClustrix_TPCC_Percona.pdf Percona-Clustrix TPCC Evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt; a three-node cluster saw about a 73% increase in speed over a similarly equipped single MySQL server running tests with 1024 simultaneous threads.  Additional nodes added to the Clustrix cluster provided roughly linear increases in speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cloudcomputingexpo2010west.sys-con.com/node/2159758 Clustrix Delivers Software-Only Kit to Demo Shard-less MySQL Scaling]&lt;/ref&gt;
