      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Kinoton HDFS''' ([[High Definition Film System]]) was a prototype 35&amp;nbsp;mm motion picture film format proposed by German projector company [[Kinoton]] and developed with the film camera company [[ARRI]] and the Swiss company [[Studer]]. The format was developed between 1988 and 1990. It proposed removing the optical soundtrack from film prints, and using the SMPTE 80 bit timecode printed onto the film print, combined with two [[CD-ROM]] drives to provide a four channel digital soundtrack. The removal of the soundtrack would also allow more of the film area to be used during filming, increasing the quality.

The format was not adopted.
