'''DocFetcher''' is an [[open source]] [[desktop search]] application that runs on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X|Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]]. It is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and has a [[Standard Widget Toolkit]] based [[graphical user interface]].

DocFetcher's indexing and searching facilities are based on [[Lucene|Apache Lucene]], a widely used open source search engine.

==Features==
* Supports all major document formats, including [[PDF]], [[HTML]], [[Microsoft Office]] and [[OpenOffice.org]]
* Supported archive formats: zip, 7z, rar, tar.*
* Can search in Outlook emails (PST files)
* Can be customized to index any kind of source code file
* Automatically updates its indexes whenever files are modified
* Exclusion of files from indexing based on [[regular expressions]]

==Portability==
DocFetcher is available as a portable version, which allows the user to bundle DocFetcher and his or her personal files in order to create a portable and searchable "document repository". Portable means the user may for instance carry around this repository on a USB drive, or a synchronize it over multiple computers via a [[File synchronization|file synchronization service]]. Also, due to the fact that DocFetcher is Java-based, this repository can be accessed from different platforms, e.g. from Windows as well as from Linux.

==Pairing of HTML files==
By default, DocFetcher treats pairs of HTML files (e.g. a file named foo.html and a folder named foo_files) as a single document. The purpose of this is to improve the quality of the search results by hiding files inside the HTML folders, which users are usually not interested and which can therefore be considered "noise".
