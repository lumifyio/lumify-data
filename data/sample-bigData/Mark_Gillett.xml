'''Mark Gillett''' is a British executive and software engineer who serves as corporate vice president in the [[Microsoft Skype Division]]. He is best known for his work leading and transforming the engineering and operations of [[Skype]], which he took responsibility for as Chief Development and Operations Officer while Skype was an independent company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-23/skype-says-jonathan-chadwick-of-mcafee-joins-as-finance-chief.html |title=Skype Hires McAffee's Jonathan Chadwick and Silver Lake's Mark Gillett as it approaches IPO | publisher=bloomberg.com | date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to its acquisition by Microsoft.

He runs the Skype team as well as the engineering team that builds [[Microsoft Lync]], which was merged with Skype in September 2012.

Gillett joined [[Skype Technologies]] from [[Silver Lake Partners]] following the departure of Madhu Yarlagadda in 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/18/skypes-chief-development-officer-leaves-amid-techcrunch-comment-fiasco/ | title = Skype's Chief Development Officer leaves  | publisher=techcrunch.com |date= 18 August 2010 | accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is credited with re-organizing Skype's global development organization and transitioning Skype to an [[agile software development]] methodology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://microsoftjobsblog.com/blog/inside-skype | title = Insider Skype, Geek in Question, Mark Gillett  | publisher=jobs.microsoft.com |date= 13 February 2012 | accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the frequency with which new versions of products are delivered to users from years down to as little as a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thedeal.com/magazine/ID/045961/features/silver-lake-skype.php | title = Silver Lake: Skype| publisher=thedeal.com |date= 13 April 2012 | accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skype and Microsoft ==
At Skype, Gillett has led the scaling of both the Skype platform and Skype team to support growth in connected and active (concurrent) users estimated to be from &lt;10M concurrent users in 2009 to &gt;50M by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/14/skype-reaches-a-45m-concurrent-user-peak-and-what-looks-like-a-new-stage-of-momentum/ | title = Skype's momentum accelerates| publisher=techcrunch.com|date= 14 October 2012 | accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillett led the planning and execution for Skype's integration into Microsoft &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/skype-what-kind-of-infrastructure-changes-has-microsoft-made/12612  | title = Skype's Integration into Microsoft Data Centres | publisher=zdnet.com|date= 1 May 2012 | accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the significant re-organization of the product and operations functions as Chief Development and Operations Officer of the company prior to Microsoft's acquisition.  Gillett's leadership has been marked by significant re-architecture to support mobile clients and Microsoft's Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2411236,00.asp  | title = Skype for Windows 8 Launches | publisher=pcmag.com|date= 22 October 2012 | accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gillett announced the company's new architecture in a blog post about a new Skype Windows 8 client in October 2012 (one year after Skype's acquisition by Microsoft and the same week as Windows 8's launch).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.skype.com/2012/10/21/skype-for-windows8/#fbid=hRll1kU5Bot | title = Welcome Skype for Windows 8: It's Fast, Easy and Beautiful| publisher=skype.com|date= 21 October 2012 | accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to delivering a new architecture and clients for Microsoft's [[Windows 8]] (October 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.skype.com/2012/10/21/skype-for-windows8/#fbid=y17QcZgQOp2|publisher=Skype|title=Welcome Skype for Windows 8: It's Fast, Easy and Beautiful|accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows Phone]] (November 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.skype.com/2012/11/12/skype-for-windows-phone-8-in/#fbid=y17QcZgQOp2|publisher=Skype|title=Skype for Windows Phone 8 â€“ install the Preview today|accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Xbox platforms, following the acquisition, Gillett and [[Tony Bates]] have continued to lead the division with a focus on extending Skype reach and engagement from the web, across mobile and at work with key Microsoft products like [[Internet Explorer]] (August 2011) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.skype.com/2011/08/23/we-have-released-skype-click-t/#fbid=9Rgd4OnsSye|publisher=Skype|title=Skype Click to Call for Windows update|accessdate= 2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bing]](Skype Bing Reward and Bing Bar in February 2012) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.skype.com/2011/08/23/we-have-released-skype-click-t/#fbid=9Rgd4OnsSye|publisher=Skype|title=Skype 5.8 for Windows: Full HD video-calling, Facebook integration, Group Screen Sharing= 2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]] (January 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.skype.com/2013/01/10/skype-61-for-windows-desktop-w/#fbid=y17QcZgQOp2|publisher=Skype|title=Skype 6.1 for Windows Desktop with Outlook Integration|accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently upgrading [[Windows Live Messenger]] with Skype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.skype.com/2013/02/15/skype-and-messenger-coming-together-the-next-chapter/#fbid=y17QcZgQOp2|publisher=Skype|title=Skype and Messenger Coming Together: The Next Chapter|accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillett is attributed with leading the growth of Skype's engineering function in London and Prague, including with the opening and design of a new office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.t3.com/news/skype-opens-new-london-office  | title = Skype opens new London office | publisher=t3.com|date= 22 March 2013| accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Chancery Lane, London housing 380 UK based [[Microsoft Skype Division]] staff and with &gt;40% growth in staff during 2012/2013.

== Controversy ==

Gillett's re-organization of the engineering and operations team at Skype has been reported as rapid, taking place in only a "short number of months", which courted some controversy and drew attention as a part of a wider criticism of Skype's stock option plan by a disgruntled former employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://framethink.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/how-employees-get-screwed-in-private-equity-deals/ | title = .. employees . . . in private equity deals | publisher=Yee Lee |date= 24 June 2011 | accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also been active in defending the changes made to the Skype business and architecture in the face of criticism from privacy advocates - initially following the 2010 service interruption Gillett's team radically changed Skype's architecture moving away from a pure Peer to Peer approach, implementing cloud based supernodes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/05/skype-replaces-p2p-supernodes-with-linux-boxes-hosted-by-microsoft/ | title = Skype replaces P2P supernodes with Linux boxes hosted by Microsoft| publisher=arstechnica.com |date= 1 May 2012 | accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently refuting allegations that these changes had been made to facilitate law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zdnet.com/skype-talks-back-to-critics-on-security-and-privacy-7000001682/ | title = Skype talks back to critics on security and privacy | publisher=zdnet.com |date= 27 July 2012 | accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillett is reported as having been a strong advocate for and proponent of the introduction of Transparency Reporting at both Skype and Microsoft, leading to its introduction in early 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/reporting/transparency/ | title = 2012 Law Enforcement Requests Report  | publisher=microsoft.com |date= 21 March 2013 | accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Gillett has raised concerns about the volume of skilled Program and Product Management engineers in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/interview/2261900/make-it-better-skype-bemoans-lack-of-business-savvy-product-developers-video | title = Make IT Better: Skype's Mark Gillett bemoans shortage of UK business savvy product developers| publisher=v3.co.uk |date= 18 April 2013 | accessdate= 8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically calling out the lack of cross trained business oriented engineers.
