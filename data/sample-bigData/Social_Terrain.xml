The '''Social Terrain''' is the methodology of using publicly available social media content found on the [[World Wide Web]] to characterize or describe a place or piece of geography. Like [[Human Terrain]] analysis, the Social Terrain utilizes several social science disciplines including [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[architecture]], [[ecology]], [[geography]] and [[linguistics]] to provide decision makers with an understanding of a population of people. However, the data used to create any analytic-derived products are typically [[crowdsourced]] or publicly available content which ultimately lowers the possibility of synthesized or manufactured information. It is believed that the "crowd" has the ability to characterize the local population of a region based on the data that they post about it on the Web. 

Because the volumes of data surpass traditional means of storage and dissemination, [[Big Data]] mining and analytical techniques are often used to sift through the vast amounts of [[social media]] content. These techniques include but are not limited to the use of high throughput [[NoSQL]] data stores and real-time processing algorithm development.
