'''Query languages''' are [[computer language]]s used to make queries into [[database]]s and [[information system]]s.

Broadly, query languages can be classified according to whether they are database query languages or [[information retrieval query language]]s. The difference is that a database query language attempts to give factual answers to factual questions, while an information retrieval query language attempts to find documents containing information that is relevant to an area of inquiry.

Examples include:
* [[.QL]] is a proprietary object-oriented query language for querying [[relational database]]s; successor of Datalog;
* [[Contextual Query Language]] (CQL) a formal language for representing queries to [[information retrieval]] systems such as web indexes or bibliographic catalogues.
* CQLF (CODASYL Query Language, Flat) is a query language for [[CODASYL]]-type databases;
* [[Concept-Oriented Query Language]] (COQL) is used in the concept-oriented model (COM). It is based on a novel [[data modeling]] construct, concept, and uses such operations as projection and de-projection for multi-dimensional analysis, analytical operations and inference;
* [[D (data language specification)|D]] is a query language for [[Relational database management system|truly relational database management systems]] (TRDBMS);
* [[Data Mining Extensions|DMX]] is a query language for [[Data Mining]] models;
* [[Datalog]] is a query language for [[deductive database]]s;
* [[Gellish English]] is a language that can be used for queries in Gellish English Databases, for dialogues (requests and responses) as well as for information modeling and [[knowledge modeling]];&lt;ref&gt;http://gellish.wiki.sourceforge.net/Querying+a+Gellish+English+database&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[HTSQL]] is a query language that translates [[HTTP]] queries to [[SQL]];
* [[ISBL]] is a query language for [[PRTV]], one of the earliest relational database management systems;
* [[LINQ]] query-expressions is a way to query various data sources from [[.NET Framework|.NET]] languages
* [[LDAP]] is an [[application protocol]] for querying and modifying [[directory services]] running over [[TCP/IP]];
* [[Molecular Query Language|MQL]] is a [[cheminformatics]] query language for a [[substructure search]] allowing beside nominal properties also numerical properties;
* [[MultiDimensional eXpressions|MDX]] is a query language for [[OLAP]] databases;
* [[Object Query Language|OQL]] is Object Query Language;
* [[Object Constraint Language|OCL]] (Object Constraint Language). Despite its name, OCL is also an object query language and an [[Object Management Group|OMG]] standard;
* [[OPath]], intended for use in querying [[WinFS]] ''Stores'';
* [[OttoQL]], intended for querying tables, [[XML]], and databases;
* [[Poliqarp Query Language]] is a special query language designed to analyze annotated text. Used in the [[Poliqarp]] search engine;
* [[QUEL query languages|QUEL]] is a [[relational database]] access language, similar in most ways to [[SQL]];
* [[RDQL]] is a [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] query language;
* [[Smiles arbitrary target specification|SMARTS]] is the [[cheminformatics]] standard for a [[substructure search]];
* [[SPARQL]] is a query language for [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] [[Graph (mathematics)|graphs]];
* [[SPL (Search Processing Language)|SPL]] is a search language for machine-generated big data, based upon Unix Piping and SQL.
* [[SQL]] is a well known query language and [[Data Manipulation Language]] for [[relational database]]s;
* [[SuprTool]] is a proprietary query language for SuprTool, a database access program used for accessing data in ''Image/SQL'' (formerly [[TurboIMAGE]]) and Oracle databases;
* [[TMQL]] Topic Map Query Language is a query language for [[Topic Maps]];
* [[XQuery]] is a query language for [[XML database|XML data sources]];
* [[XPath]] is a declarative language for navigating XML documents;
* [[XSPARQL]] is an integrated query language combining XQuery with SPARQL to query both XML and RDF data sources at once;
* [[Yahoo! query language|YQL]] is an [[SQL]]-like query language created by [[Yahoo!]]
