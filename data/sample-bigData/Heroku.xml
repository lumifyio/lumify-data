'''Heroku''' is a cloud [[Platform as a service|platform as a service (PaaS)]] supporting several [[programming language]]s. Heroku is owned by [[Salesforce.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Salesforce signs definitive agreement to acquire Heroku | url = http://news.heroku.com/news_releases/salesforcecom-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-heroku | publisher = Heroku | type = news release}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heroku, one of the first [[Cloud computing|cloud platforms]], has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby programming language]], but has since added support for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Node.js]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Clojure]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and (undocumented) [[PHP]] and [[Perl]]. The base operating system is [[Debian]] or, in the newest stack, the Debian-based [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stacks | publisher=Heroku Dev Center|url=https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
James Lindenbaum, Adam Wiggins, and Orion Henry founded Heroku supporting [[Rack (web server interface)|Rack]]-compatible projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/08/ruby-on-rails-startup-heroku-gets-3-million | date = 2008-05-08 | title = Ruby on Rails Startup Heroku Gets $3 Million | publisher = Tech Crunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009 Byron Sebastian joined Heroku as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://venturebeat.com/2009/10/14/sourcelabs-byron-sebastian-joins-heroku-as-ceo | date = 2009-10-14 | title = SourceLabs' Byron Sebastian Joins Heroku as CEO | publisher = Venture Beat}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 2010 Salesforce.com acquired Heroku as a wholly owned subsidiary of Salesforce.com. On July 12, 2011 [[Yukihiro Matsumoto|Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto]], the creator of the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby programming language]], joined the company as Chief Architect, Ruby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | type = weblog | url = http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/7/12/matz_joins_heroku/ |title=Matz joins Heroku | date = 2011-07-12 | publisher = Heroku}}&lt;/ref&gt; That month, Heroku included support for [[Node.js]] and [[Clojure]]. On September 15, 2011 Heroku and [[Facebook]] introduced Heroku for Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/558/ | contribution = Facebook and Heroku: an even easier way to get started | publisher = Facebook | title = Developers | type = weblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heroku now supports [[Cloudant]], [[Couchbase Server]], [[MongoDB]] and [[Redis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2010/7/20/nosql/ | publisher = Heroku | date = 2010-07-20 | title = NoSQL, Heroku, and You | type = weblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; besides the standard [[PostgreSQL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/database | contribution = Database | title = Dev Centre | publisher = Heroku | accessdate = 2012-05-03 | quote = Heroku offers you the choice of running on a shared or dedicated database package. The shared plan is suitable for development and staging applications. It runs Postgres 8.3. The dedicated plans are suitable for production scale applications. In addition, the dedicated databases offer a number of advantages, including direct access (via psql or any native postgres library), stored procedures, and Postgres 9 support.}}&lt;/ref&gt; both as part of the platform and as a standalone service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://postgres.heroku.com/ | publisher = Heroku | title = SQL Database-as-a-Service: the largest and most reliable Postgres service in the world | accessdate = 2012-05-03 | quote = A powerful, reliable, and durable open-source SQL-compliant database, PostgreSQL is the datastore of choice for serious applications. Now it is available in seconds with a single click. Never worry about servers. Never worry about config files. Never worry about patches. Simply focus on your data.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications that are run from the Heroku server use the Heroku [[DNS Server]] to direct to the application domain (typically "applicationname.herokuapp.com"). Each of the application dynos are spread across a "dyno grid" which consists of several servers. Heroku's [[Git (software)|Git]] server handles application repository pushes from permitted users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quora.com/Scalability/How-does-Heroku-work Scalability: How does Heroku work?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[June 2012 North American derecho]] caused many applications hosted by Heroku to go offline. The service outage lasted less than 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ludwig|first=Sear|title=Amazon cloud outage takes down Netflix, Instagram, Pinterest, &amp; more|url=http://venturebeat.com/2012/06/29/amazon-outage-netflix-instagram-pinterest/|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=VentureBeat|date=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, newly launching technology companies began referencing Heroku when describing their own, new cloud offerings and &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bracy, James|title=Heroku for X|url=http://www.waratuman.com/2011/01/28/heroku-for-x/}}“Heroku for X” became shorthand&lt;/ref&gt; for just about any effort to build a “platform cloud” or web service designed to take the pain out of building, deploying, and hosting online applications. Referencing Heroku in these efforts was to pay homage to  one of Silicon Valley VC firm, [[Y Combinator (company)|YCombinator’s]] biggest exits to date — the $212 million sale of Heroku to Salesforce.com in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Finley |first=Klint |url=http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/09/heroku/ |title=As Heroku Boss Flees to Olive Farm, Where's the Platform Cloud Going? &amp;#124; Wired Enterprise |publisher=Wired.com |date=2013-03-07 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heroku is often called on as "the gold standard, every other clone of Heroku has fallen short."{{Citation needed|reason=ambiguous source|date=June 2013}}
