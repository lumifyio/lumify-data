==Internet infrastructure==
In 2007 and 2008 Nemertes published widely publicized reports on Internet infrastructure trends focusing on bandwidth demand versus build-out, and more recently, logical Internet issues involving IP address depletion and route table scalability. In particular, its widely noted report, "Internet Interrupted: Why Architectural Limitations Will Fracture the 'Net" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nemertes.com/internet_interrupted_why_architectural_limitations_will_fracture_net Internet Interrupted: Why Architectural Limitations Will Fracture The 'Net]&lt;/ref&gt; Nemertes argued that Internet access capacity will become insufficient to handle demand as early as 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nemertes.com/studies/internet_infrastructure_study_frequently_asked_questions_faq]&lt;/ref&gt; These findings have supported the positions on the need to increase internet capacity taken by the [[Internet Innovation Alliance]] (IIA),.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2007-11-18-slow-internet_N.htm USA Today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/24/AR2007112400807.html Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt; The findings and conclusions of such reports have been widely criticized &lt;ref&gt;Timothy Karr [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/timothy-karr/suckered-by-astroturf_b_73483.html Suckered by Astroturf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steve Lohr [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E4D6173CF930A35751C1A9619C8B63 Bits]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nate Anderson [http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/10/the-internet-is-about-to-die-literally-die.ars The Internet is about to die. Literally die!]&lt;/ref&gt; though Nemertes argued that data caps and restrictions on streaming services validated their findings.&lt;ref&gt;Johna Till Johnson [http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2009/050609-johnson.html The Internet Sky Really is Falling.]&lt;/ref&gt;
