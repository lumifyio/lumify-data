''About a collaborative project to collect speed limits. Not to be confused with the [[Wikipedia:Wiki Game|wiki game]] of the same name''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikispeedia.net|title=Wikispeedia.net|quote=Website of the wiki game called Wikispeedia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wikispeedia''' is an [[open data]] collaborative project to collect a database of the locations of all [[speed limit]]s around the world. It was started in 2005.

==History==
Wikispeedia was created in 2005 to create a [[cruise control]] system that was responsive to local speed limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mp3car.com/vbulletin/engine-management-obd-ii-engine-diagnostics-etc/20117-cruise-control-question-2.html|title=Mp3car|quote="Thought you might learning that we are building a gps-cruisecontrol. We need help somehow in creating a big database of US speedlimit signs. Please help."}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turned it into a DIY kit tested initially by Matt Despain in Salt Lake City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Ipc8W0wgJrTjFzwsITynZJgAMWEcLc95_j98BMT0uo/edit?hl=en_US|title=Matt Despain bought a DIY cruise control kit in 2006|quote="Matt bought a DIY kit in 2006"}}&lt;/ref&gt;A suitable speed limit database was not available so the Open Speed Limit Database project was created in 2006 to collect the required information (originally known as Osldb.org). In 2007, the project was renamed wikispeedia.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1438494&amp;cid=30050046&amp;art_pos=3|title=Slashdot.org|quote="Fight back by adding some speed limits at Wikispeedia (wikispeedia.org)"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch of the [[iPhone]] in 2007 led to increased demand for speed limits data but there was still limited data in the database.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 2009 some fifth and sixth grade school children developed an online computer game to virtually drive around a city using [[Google Street View]] finding speed limit signs which could then be transcribed into wikispeedia for the [[FIRST Robotics Competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/lincoln/news/education/x1145289873/Lincoln-students-research-Smart-Moves|title=Wikedlocal.com|quote="We think that having an online collection of speed limit data is a neat idea,‚Äù added Thompson. The Red Team started entering data for the Lincoln area and has logged about 200 speed limit signs. As a result of these contributions, the Red Team has been highlighted on Wikispeedia."}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011 some 300 volunteers had collected 30,000 signs at which point a further 26,000,000 'default' speed limits were added algorithmically worldwide based on [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|Tiger road data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpscruise1.blogspot.com/2010/10/crowdsourcing-for-dummies.html|title=Crowdsourcing eventually bloats (or does it)|quote="In five years we have netted 50k signs with 300 unique contributors...Last year my buddy Ben de Waal from Germany suggested that we put in "suggested" speed limits based on road-type. So I went off to census.gov, and harvested 26 Million "suggested" speed limits. Turns out this data is available for other countries, so if people help me understand the language, we do other countries as well. This is  free data, but as you see below, the census system has lousy precision, only 4 digits of lat, lon, and even that last digit has round off errors".}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2010 the [[MODOT|Missouri Department of Transportation]] and the [[DelDOT|Delaware Department of Transportation]] allowed WikiSpeedia access to their realtime [[variable speed limit]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} By early 2011 the Wikispeedia database contained 28 million speed limit entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpscruise1.blogspot.com/2011/06/contributions.html|title=Contributions|quote="28 million Contributions"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikispeedia is registered as a 502(a)(2) charity with the state of Tennessee. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tn.gov/sos/charity/|title=Wikispeedia|quote="Charity"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wikispeedia.png|thumb|Growth from Contributors]] 

Minnesota: In Oct 2011, MN became the first entity to contact WikiSpeedia for a bi-directional data share of highway speed limits.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpscruise1.blogspot.com/2011/10/almost-canada.html|title=Minnesota|quote="Nathan Drews of Minnesota DOT requests a bi-directional speed limit share."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Sam Krajewski from Maine.gov contributed 35k signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpscruise1.blogspot.com/2011/10/almost-canada.html|title=Maine|quote="Sam Krajewski from maine.gov contributes signs."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
A number of products use Wikispeedia data, including:

* Speed limit indicator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/oswego.edu/mapse/about|title=Viewer|quote=Speed limit indicator.:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2012, Doug Moeller entered into a speed-limit sharing conversation by offsetting some Wikispeedia hosting costs. He has a related app called Speed Tracker. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonetmobile.com/apps/|title=Speed Tracker Safety App|quote=Safety App:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2009, Alex BenBassat purchased a snapshot of speed limits for his aSafeDrive App.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asafedrive.com/|title=aSafeDrive iPhone App|quote=Safety App:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Instant Speed Limit Viewer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikispeedia.org/speedlimit|title=Viewer|quote=Shows the Speed Limit from any location aware browser.:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==API==
Speed limits can be read by submitting a box as follows:

http://www.wikispeedia.org/a/marks_bb2.php?name=all&amp;nelat=35.198676&amp;swlat=35.194676&amp;nelng=-89.56558&amp;swlng=-89.56958

Similar commands exist for submitting and deleting signs from the database. (see FAQ below)

You can access Wikispeedia data through the API from R, using the R package [https://github.com/SChamberlain/rwikispeedia rwikispeedia]. 

==Visualizations of Wikispeedia data==
Visualization of speed limit changes in St. Louis using Google Visualizations.  Find the visualization [https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/wikispeedia/yccSElpZexY here].
