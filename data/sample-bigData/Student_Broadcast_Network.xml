      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Student Broadcast Network''' or '''SBN''' was a company who provided a sustaining service, news and advertising for [[Student Radio]] stations in the [[United Kingdom]].

It provided syndicated music based programmes and an hourly news service across the UK via satellite. Stations received money in return for broadcasting SBN's content and advertising. In 2004 SBN was closed by its parent company Campus Media, leaving many student stations with large gaps in their budgets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/aug/11/radio.students&lt;/ref&gt;
