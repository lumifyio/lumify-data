== Are unreliable sources better than no sources? ==

I recently saw a series of edits where one editor removed sources because they were unreliable ([[WP:SPS|self-published]] and [[WP:USERGENERATED|user-generated]]) and a second editor restored them because they were the only sources and so "must remain". Is this really the case? I read [[WP:RS]] and can't find anything that says that unreliable sources are better than no sources. Doesn't the acceptance of unreliable sources give the reader the impression that the information is credible, when it may not be? I ask this as a general question, rather than one about a specific article because it's an issue that exists everywhere.  [[Special:Contributions/75.2.209.11|75.2.209.11]] ([[User talk:75.2.209.11|talk]]) 14:23, 10 January 2013 (UTC)
:I'm not sure if we've ever had a discussion about that.  I'll have to think about this, but here's what I usually do:
:* If the content is good (it's reasonably well-written, meets NPOV, and other content policies, etc.), and I think a reliable source can be found, I'll either find a better source myself or remove the source and add a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{fact}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag to it.
:* If the content is bad (poorly written, factually inacurate, fails NPOV) or I don't think a reliable source can be found, I'll remove the content.
:Another option is to leave the source in and add a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{unreliable source?}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag to it.  [[User:A Quest For Knowledge|A Quest For Knowledge]] ([[User talk:A Quest For Knowledge|talk]]) 14:48, 10 January 2013 (UTC)
::Always ask yourself whether the topic is notable. If it is not covered in independent sources, probably not. If the topic is definitely notable but most of the article is not supported by sources, perhaps the article needs to be stubbed down.

:::This is all good in an ideal world. In a miriad of cases though, the information is notable and covered in many good sources, but they are not cited... because no one has bothered. Doing it yourself? Well, life is short and all of us have other things to do. Adding proper references to every article I see is lots of work, and don't get me started on things not available online. - [[User:BorisG|BorisG]] ([[User talk:BorisG|talk]]) 17:34, 10 January 2013 (UTC)
:::At first glance, a low-quality source (or even a very-low-quality source) seems better than no source. However, low-quality sources often go hand in hand with other problems. For instance, if an editor wants the article to say something which ''reliable'' sources don't say, that may be a red flag for problems of [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]] or [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]]. [[User:Bobrayner|bobrayner]] ([[User talk:Bobrayner|talk]]) 17:14, 10 January 2013 (UTC)

'''Maybe -''' It may depend. I remember one controversy where I was an involved editor (CISPA/SOPA) where the author of the major implementation (BIND) of a critical networking protocol (DNS) said on a blog or in a speech, I forget which, that yes indeed the proposed law would break the internet. Since the world wide web depends on DNS, this is pretty close to getting it straight from the horse's mouth, but an opposing editor would not allow it to go in, because, no indeed, it did not meet reliability guidelines. And yet his idea of a good source was Newsmax, which, slanted as it is, does have editorial review...gah. Just saying. 
	
I do understand the rationale here, that the average person will not necessarily know who the man is, although -- to complain about this just a little more -- a quick google would have remedied this. My point in sharing this example though is that there are good sources which are not necessarily reliable under Wikipedia policy, and in information technology in particular, since this is where I have run into this, certain personal blogs are very good sources indeed. I do not know how to formulate a rule that will differentiate them from the sort of dross that led to the policy, but....if there is no dispute as to accuracy, I think it depends on whether this is a page someone put up three years ago, or that someone is carefully tending on an ongoing basis, in which case it may be worth discussing the reasons for the sourcing....

:@Elinruby: Without knowing the details, I'm not sure if that other editor was correct in say that particular source was unreliable.  [[User:A Quest For Knowledge|A Quest For Knowledge]] ([[User talk:A Quest For Knowledge|talk]]) 17:32, 10 January 2013 (UTC)
::Undoubtedly, blogs of known experts and notable people are excellent sources of their opinions. It is absurd to think that an opinion expressed in a newspaper interview is more reliable than expressed in the person's own blog. - [[User:BorisG|BorisG]] ([[User talk:BorisG|talk]]) 17:39, 10 January 2013 (UTC)
:::But that is what a literal reading of the policy gets you. This came out of this board, by the way; you can look it up if you want. The expert's name is Paul Vixie. But that's not the issue. I understand the policy and why that happened; the other editor demanded proof that the expert was indeed an expert, and none of it was to his satisfaction. It was a fairly contentious editing process ;) However, my main point is that sometimes Wikipedia's policy's do not foresee all possibilities. If a source that meets RS guidelines is available, it should be used. But I am just noting that I'm aware of cases where very good sources have been dissed because they did not meet the letter of the policy. How about the blog of a reporter who has been covering a story, to give another example. He's not an "expert" on the topic, except that he will have extensively researched it, and perhaps will be able on his own blog to say things he cannot in his stories. Just saying, it's not always that simple. [[User:Elinruby|Elinruby]] ([[User talk:Elinruby|talk]]) 18:35, 10 January 2013 (UTC)

:Generally no. Anyone can make a website. an editor who wants to publish things in his mind on wikipedia can make homepages under various URLs and refer to himself as a third party.

[[User:Cantaloupe2|Cantaloupe2]] ([[User talk:Cantaloupe2|talk]]) 10:53, 11 January 2013 (UTC)

I think that as per the normal guidelines, there is no simple general rule for a question like this. We need to discuss real examples. All the answers above appear to me to be imagining various situations first, before answering. How bad is the bad source? How bad is the rest of the article? etc.--[[User:Andrew Lancaster|Andrew Lancaster]] ([[User talk:Andrew Lancaster|talk]]) 12:34, 13 January 2013 (UTC)
:::that's pretty much my thought.

::An informal point here. Have you ever seen a reputed text book or even a good book refer to a blog for a material? Trust me, if I pay $99 for a book and the author says ''Wikipedia says (or my blog says) cloud computing is ...'', I am going to be mightily dissapointed. I mean, the author is not even knowledgable enough to say in his words what such-and-such term means and has to look it up in Wikipedia? Isn't the guy an expert on the subject? Have you ever heard Bill Gates or anyone regarded as an expert on something say ''don't buy my book, just read my blog!''. OK, apart from financial considerations, there are some very good reasons. (1) Authors can rarely negate something from a book they write unless there are major changes. All such changes are supported by extensive reference materials. (2) Books unlike research papers are reviewed (and used) not only by experts but even by laymen and students. The chances of error-correction are much higher. (3) All reputed publishers have limits to how much and what of the original content can be changed over time. Authors can rarely contradict themselves later. (4) Authors have vested interests to keep all volumes updated with latest findings and corrections. Authors and their books have been known to be outdated long before the term became popular in computing. Blogs might stay unattended for a vareity of reasons. (5) Blogs are often used to test an idea ''before'' it is published in a formal book... The list is really long, but I hope you get the idea. -[[User:Wikishagnik|Wikishagnik]] ([[User talk:Wikishagnik|talk]]) 13:54, 14 January 2013 (UTC)
::::I think you have a very romantic notion of the book production process :) Note that I am not arguing that the policy is wrong, merely that it will need, eventually, to be updated, and sometimes gives bizarre results. As for your question, actually, the online Linux reference is, afaik, considered the definitive reference on the topic. You should check out hadoop.apache.com or php.com, or for that matter Andy Carvin on Twitter, lkml.org, the blogs of glenn greenwald, lawrence lessig, paul vixie or Techdirt. None of these meet RS, but they are all very serious references in their field. But their authority isn't easily demonstrated outside of those fields, and until somebody finds a way to do so its probably worth excluding them to keep out the real trash. But it *is* an issue.

Just a comment about removing a citation to an unreliable source: if the passage in the Wikipedia article was written based on an unreliable source, and a reliable source can't readily be found, it is important to remove both the passage and the citation, not just the citation, otherwise it is plagiarism. This applies even if the claim is common knowledge and not challenged. In this situation, the passage could be reworded so as not to plagiarize the unreliable source. On the other hand, if the passage was composed independently by a Wikipedia editor and the citation was added later, just the citation could be removed.

===Discusssion===
This is quite possibly the most well-presented discussion thread I've ever seen. I can't even tell which side of the issue you fall on, which is to your credit. 

The relevant part of the RS policy would be this: 
:"''Self-published expert sources may be considered reliable when produced by an established expert on the topic of the article, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable third-party publications''"

David Gorski probably does have relevant expertise per this policy. In introducing his opinion in the article, you can state explicitly that his background is in cardiology. 

Where I have a slight problem is with the chosen excerpt from Gorski's work. The fact that he referred to raw food diet film as "highly effective propaganda" does not tell me anything useful. Since Gorski would be quoted in his capacity as a medical expert, and not as a film critic, I would prefer to know what he has to say about the medical science behind the raw food trend. Overall, it seems that it should be possible to use language that is both less sensational and more informative.

:I agree that it may not be the best possible choice of quote.  The film itself is of incredibly marginal notability having attracted almost no attention from traditional sources or reviewers.  I think we should simply mention the film's existence in Cousens' article without any of its scientific claims or rebuttals, delete the films article and be done with it.  The whole thing has received so little actual attention that it hardly seems worth mentioning or wasting time discussing. --[[User:Daniel J.

::Thanks for the feedback here.  I agree that there were more relevant statements about the science in the film and I have thus used a different quote.

== Smithsonian Magazine ==

An editor has twice removed an article from the Smithsonian magazine claiming that it is wrong -"(His book says that... His book says: "Allegedly there is a book written by somebody stating that... And that is not a reliable source." That link is not a reliable source if it claims sth that was never written in the book. I will find all the citations f)". And [http://www.alternativnahistorija.com/AH1.htm#31] "The last days of April 1945. Hitler, Martin Boorman, Eva Braun and core "Nazi" leadership fleeing in Antarctica."

:Sorry, this is at {{la|Semir Osmanagić}}. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 21:58, 14 January 2013 (UTC)

:Let me just check if I'm understanding correctly.  The sentence in dispute is this:
::''"In his book ''Alternative History'' he [Osmanagić] proposed that Hitler and other leading Nazis escaped to an underground base in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/The-Mystery-of-Bosnias-Ancient-Pyramids.html?c=y&amp;page=2&lt;/ref&gt;"''

:The Smithsonian Magazine is certainly a reliable source. But the other editor seems to be arguing that Osmanagić actually does not make this claim about Hitler. If I'm reading his edit summary correctly, the editor is saying that in Osmanagić's book, he notes the existence of such a theory, but actually dismisses it. If that's true--if in his own book Osmanagić rejects the fantastical Hitler theory--then we need to consider that the Smithsonian writer got it wrong. No one is infallible. 

:I suggest asking the other editor to provide some evidence in support of his position.[[User:TheBlueCanoe|'''&lt;span style="color:black"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:green"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:black"&gt;Canoe&lt;/span&gt;''']] 22:25, 14 January 2013 (UTC)

:::The burden of proof--or, in this case, the burden of reading the book--falls on the editor who wishes to exclude the Smithsonian information.

== [[Mohammad Ali (actor)]] ==

Another editor has made it his business to delete unsourced content from around the project citing [[WP:CHALLENGE]] (and ignoring the part where it says, per [[WP:PRESERVE]], that it's better to try to find sources instead of just deleting).

One of the articles that he has recently targeted was Mohammad Ali, where he removed biographical information. In keeping with my ANI assigned responsibility to wikistalk this user, I'm trying to restore the content that he is too lazy to source himself.

Keeping in mind [[WP:BIAS]], this article is likely to be difficult to source. However, I found [http://mazhar.dk/film/stars/mohammadali.html http://mazhar.dk/film/stars/mohammadali.html] to support the biographical information (i.e., family composition, schooling). My question is whether this would be considered a reliable source?

== Mass drive-by "ref improve" tagging ==

I wasn't really sure where to bring this concern, but since it concerns sources, I thought I'd start here. [[User:Klemen Kocjancic|Klemen Kocjancic]] has begun systematically tagging articles with the ref improve tag. (See: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Klemen_Kocjancic&amp;offset=&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Klemen+Kocjancic].) I question whether such mass tagging is really helpful. In addition, some of the tags make no sense. Small town articles are being tagged when, in fact, everything in the articles is templated geographic and demographic information that is fully sourced (e.g., [[Anson, Wisconsin]], [[Anton, Texas]], [[Antrim Township, Watonwan County, Minnesota]], [[Antreville, South Carolina]], etc.)

Perhaps &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Citation needed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; would be better in those instances.

{{od}}They largely do a decent job, probably better than many of the newspapers that do qualify, but we are in danger of slippery slope if we allow personal impressions to determine what qualifies. They are self-published, with no formal training in journalism, as far as I know, and no formal editorial process other than self-editing. We accept newspaper and books by experts, not because they are more accurate, they often aren't, but because they have a formal editorial process for fact-checking. (Although, as an aside, many people are under the misguided impression that science books are peer-reviewed. They typically are not.) I think there are a number of blogs with a better track record for accuracy than Snopes, and both are better than the NYT, but I don't think we would start accepting blogs as reliable sources simply because some editor has followed one closely and thinks it has a good track record for accuracy. (I know there are exceptions for blogs written by individuals who have been reporters at RS's, but that's different). Frankly, I would love it if we could find a way to allow Snopes as an RS, as well as some of the more careful blogs, but I don't see an easy, objective way to identify those which qualify and those which do not.
I tend to use Snopes the same way I use Wikipedia - I accept that they are largely correct, have a bit of a political bias, so certain subjects are more questionable than others, and when in doubt, go tot he sources provided. Snopes is doing a much better job over time of including their refs, which tend to be reliable. This also provides an option for someone wishing to cite Snopes—go to the reference they provide, and cite that.--[[User:Sphilbrick|&lt;span style="color:#002868;padding:0 4px;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light"&gt;SPhilbrick&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Sphilbrick|&lt;span style=";padding:0 4px;color:# 000;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light"&gt;(Talk)&lt;/span&gt;]] 14:25, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

Some don't bother with fact checking. I have worked with authors of statistical texts whose work was rigorously checked. I've also worked as a fact checker of a book, again statistical related.

Snopes.com is undeniably a reliable source. It has a tremendous reputation for fact-checking and is well accepted by countless other reliable sources throughout the world. Saying that you should use the sources listed on its page instead of snopes.com itself misses the point, in that those original sources may be where certain facts or claims came from, but the article on snopes.com itself sometimes comes to its own conclusions or introduces its own research. Those articles always have been allowed here as reliable sources, and demanding we use other sources they cite instead can force situations where that other source doesn't back up the part needing a reference here. It's also pretty much the same as demanding that whenever we cite any book that is reliable that also has footnotes or end notes in it to only ever use the sources listed in those footnotes or endnotes instead of the reliable source. It's ridiculous. Now, certainly there are going to be cases where some other source is more appropriate (instead of more reliable) than snopes.com, but trying to claim it's not reliable or only reliable for other sources is simply untrue.

:I'm going to have to agree with DreamGuy here. Snopes is widely accepted as accurate and reliable, and those are the criteria which matter. That they are an exception to the usual publishing methodology I accept as noted, and find it ironic that as we on Wikipedia are ''also'' an exception to the usual publishing methodology, we are all the more terrified of accepting anyone else who isn't dead-tree and peer-reviewed. Obviously we must not accept poor sourcing, which almost all such sites are, but blindly following the letter of policy and not being able to see exceptions is wankery. Remember that in all we do, we should be seeking to improve the encyclopedia - not try to ensure we become so rules-bound we forget why we're here. If there are better sources, sure, use them - but eliminating Snopes due to a mindless adherence to rules which are in place to ''help us identify'' reliable sources, not in place to ''help us rule out'' reliable sources, makes no sense.

== Reliable sources for alternative theories on the [[natural-born-citizen clause]]? ==

A discussion has arisen at [[Talk:Natural-born-citizen clause]] (see [[Talk:Natural-born-citizen clause#Major Revision Needed|here]]) regarding whether [[WorldNetDaily]] (WND) is or is not a reliable source for what are generally held to be fringe theories regarding the true meaning of the US Constitution's requirements for the office of President.  The person advocating the use of material from WND is also arguing that the alternative theories in question are in fact legitimate viewpoints from "scholarly legal people or groups", which need to be acknowledged in the article in order to preserve NPOV and "illustrate the existence and extent of the controversy" — and that labelling these theories as fringe, and the sources backing them (most of which appear to me to be blogs) as unreliable, is indicative of an attempt "to try to pick a side and suppress the other side".

I challenged the editor in question to take the issue here, but he appeared reluctant to do so (opining instead that "making an 'effort to open up a wider discussion on one of the above noticeboards' is what administrators are for, we're just editors").  I don't agree with this view, but in an effort to move the discussion along and not allow it to simply stagnate, I'm bringing it here.  Hopefully I've characterized the other editor's arguments correctly here; if not, I trust he'll correct me.

Comments welcome — here, and/or at [[Talk:Natural-born-citizen clause]].  Thanks.  —&amp;nbsp;[[User:Richwales|&lt;u&gt;Rich&lt;/u&gt;]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] &lt;small&gt;''(no&amp;nbsp;relation to Jimbo)''&lt;/small&gt; 06:50, 15 January 2013 (UTC)

:Whether or not a theory is fringe is an issue for [[Wikipedia:Fringe theories/Noticeboard]]. There is no prohibition against discussing alternative theories as long as it is not given undue weight relevant to its prominence. Questions regarding whether or not specific sources for those theories can be used is an issue for ''this'' noticeboard. Hard to say until we know what they are.
:On that point, WorldNetDaily might be a reliable source for a statement about itself or a statement of opinion with attribution, but it is unlikely to be regarded as a reliable source for a statement of fact due to the widely-held perception (true or not) that it publishes from a biased political perspective. As always, context matters. [[User:Location|Location]] ([[User talk:Location|talk]]) 07:48, 15 January 2013 (UTC)

::Three groupings of sources illustrate the problems for this article:

::1. '''Quotes representing “Birther scholars"''' Being blogs, these are not acceptable sources for showing what is or is not fact; yet, they accurately show why these people believe as they do, what they have said, and what their side of the dispute is. The sources are long legal-thought websites with point after point trying to prove what they have specifically taken to court. They accurately reflect their bias.

::2. '''CRS quotes used in the article''' itself:“Birther scholar,” Attorney Leo Donofrio, essentially (putting it politely) asks this question of the [http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42097.pdf%20 CRS memo ]author, Attorney Jack Maskell: Why did he reconstruct [http://naturalborncitizen.wordpress.com/2011/12/01/debunking-the-new-natural-born-citizen-congressional-research-propaganda/ a key Supreme Court quote]when he knew the original did ''not'' say what the reconstruction said? And, critical to his thrust, “Maskell never mentions that the father and mother were US citizens at the time of petitioner’s birth in California.” Depending on interpretation, the change affects the credibility of the CRS memo upon which some of the article is obviously patterned (starting with the first quote and stating the view that the Natural-Born-Clause article reflects).
 
::3. '''WND''' (which I think is “over-the-top” frequently). Yet, what source hasn’t taken sides (their bias) on the Birther subject?  If you believe Israel’s “Birther” and [http://www.science.co.il/Obama-Birth-Certificate.htm%20%20main-science%20web%20portal main-science web portal], then [http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/in-arizona-the-bigoted-birther-is-back/%20 The New York Times]and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_PySJVvJW4&amp;feature=related%20 CNBC] among many in the national media) launched pure [[Rules for Radicals|"Alinskys"]] against Birthers either maliciously or without doing their homework.  And if countries are watching the issue, as [http://www.wnd.com/2012/03/ex-communist-nations-expose-obama-fraud/ WND] says they are, then  WND has an argument much bigger than “Fringe.”  That shouldn’t be too hard to verify on the Internet.  Yes, context matters immensely, yet dispute, not Birther fact or fiction, should be the context of the article. See “Fringe or Significant Dispute” on [[WP:FTN]]. mintbark 05:22, 16 January 2013 (UTC)

== Not a Flounder ==

[[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flounder|The Character]] from Disney's ''The Little Mermaid'' is '''not''' a flounder nor a guppy, the character's a yellow and blue colored tropical fish. I looked up other websites for other '''atlantic''' tropical fish I couldn't find an actual species for the character (none of the other atlantic fish has the same colors and/or patterns as him. Some of the other fish species (those that has the same colors and/or patterns as the character) only lives in the '''Indian and Pacific Oceans'''). That's why I inserted him as a juvenile [[Acanthurus coeruleus|atlantic blue tang]]. Although, the Character and the real life juvenile blue tang's fin shapes and body shapes are not similar, but his body shape and fin shapes are more like an [[Indo-Pacific]] [[Paracanthurus hepatus|regal blue tang]].


=== Atlantic blue tang juvenile ===

Real life juvenile atlantic blue tangs are bright yellow with golden blue rings around their eyes and the edges of their dorsal and anal fins. Their coloration from yellow juvenile, to yellow-tailed blue subadult, and to blue adult is not a size dependent so they could be larger then the blue adults.

Reason.com in general, especially when the article is titled "Libertarian(ish) Candidates"[http://reason.com/archives/2012/10/22/libertarianish-candidates/1] (and again, the subject's article doesn't mention this, see [[Mia Love]].

Ontheissues.org and is  [[http://www.ontheissues.org/John_Kasich.htm]] which says libertarian sufficient to call him libertarian?

[[GovTrack]] - maybe, but [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/justin_amash/412438] calls him a centrist, so how can we use it as a source to call him Libertarian?

== [[WP:NONENG]] vs. [[WP:USERG]] ==

Lately I've noticed a recurring trend in articles relating to Japanese topics. If I try to add something that I read in a Japanese book, journal or the like, sometimes I will be asked to give an English source. I can find English sources that say the same thing as the scholarly/reputably Japanese sources, but most of them are ''[[WP:USERG|some guy's personal website]]''. I don't think anyone would honestly claim that a piece of information that is backed up by both reliable foreign sources and non-reliable English sources should be deleted, but I was wondering which is better?

I ask this now, because on a move request for the page ''[[Rashōmon]]'' someone brought up the third source it cites, which is [http://www.kabuki21.com/ibaraki.php the personal website] of some guy who doesn't look Japanese but goes by the name [http://www.kabuki21.com/shoriya.php Shōriya Aragōrō]. He doesn't look like he is a recognized expert in kabuki theatre, much less in the field in question in the article. The question is whether it would be a good idea to go out and locate a Japanese source to replace this one? It's ''theoretically possible'' that a reliable source in English says the same thing, but if so it would be very hard to locate; a Japanese source could likely be located with a [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22%E6%B2%B3%E7%AB%B9%E9%BB%99%E9%98%BF%E5%BC%A5%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1#hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;tbm=bks&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22%E6%B2%B3%E7%AB%B9%E9%BB%99%E9%98%BF%E5%BC%A5%22+%22%E7%BE%85%E7%94%9F%E9%96%80%22&amp;oq=%22%E6%B2%B3%E7%AB%B9%E9%BB%99%E9%98%BF%E5%BC%A5%22+%22%E7%BE%85%E7%94%9F%E9%96%80%22&amp;gs_l=serp.3...17484.19280.1.19776.11.11.0.0.0.6.307.2187.0j7j2j2.11.0...0.0...1c.1j4.MPLz_YYECq8&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.41018144,d.dGY&amp;fp=853bb046eec7c1c5&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=653 simple Google search]. If self-published English source says the same thing as a reliable foreign source, would it be better to give both for [[WP:V]]'s sake, or delete the English one as per [[WP:RS]]?

:: WP:NONENG only says that equivalent English sources are ''preferable'' '''if''' they exist. If no equivalent English sources exist, WP:NONENG can't be used to disqualify Japanese-language sources. People's private blogs are generally not reliable, so using reliable Japanese sources would be the preferred option. And even if equivalent English sources do exist, WP:NONENG doesn't say that you can never use a Japanese one, it only says English ones are preferred. Having said that, I'd be hesitant to compose entire articles based exclusively on non-English sources.

Although apparently one similar book by Konishi Jin'ichi was translated into English, which raises the question of whether a translation is more reliable than the original, when if one only cites the translation then the choice of particular terminology might be that of the translator rather than the original author.

The rationale I was told was that if someone is interested in obscure points of French history and culture, something like the various factions of the French Revolution (for example) they may well be doing graduate work and actually read the language; and in any event a reliable French-language source is vastly better than nothing or than the the more superficial treatment that might be available in English.

A recent edit[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ayurveda&amp;diff=531930751&amp;oldid=531051759] in the article on Ayurveda has dated the Rig Veda to 10,000 years ago and has used as a source a 2011 conference presentation. As you may know, the Rig Veda was originally an oral tradition, and there is some question regarding its date of origin. Is this conference presentation considered a reliable source? Here's the ref that the editor uses:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A report on the National Seminar, held by 'Institute of Scientific Research on Vedas' Delhi Chapter, (ISERVE-Delhi) on "Scientific Dating of Ancient Events Before 2000 B.C." held on 30th and 31st July, 2011, in which the first concensus was that "The astronomical dates of planetary references in ancient books calculated by the eminent astronomers by making use of planetarium software, indicate the development of an indigenous civilization in India even prior to 6000 BC. Astronomical references in Rigveda represent the sky view of dates belonging to the period from 8000 BC to 4000 BC and those mentioned in Ramayana refer to sky views seen sequentially on dates around 5000 BC."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Apart from Astronomical finding which I mentioned above earlier, other related findings are (a) Paleobotanical research reports have revealed that certain cultivated varieties of plants, trees and herbs, which are mentioned in Vedas and Epics, have existed in India continuously for more than 8000-10,000 years. Remains of cultivated rice, wheat and barley have been found belonging to 7000 BC; melon seeds, lemon leaf, pomegranate, coconut and date palm etc relating to 4000 BC; lentils, millets and peas etc. from 3000BC. These plants remained in use continuously indicating that there was not any abrupt end of ancient Indian civilisation. (b) The latest archaeological excavations have revealed large volume of new data which has proved the indigenous origin and development of civilisation in the Indian Subcontinent since 7000 BC. Some examples are: Lahuradeva, Jhusi, Tokwa and Hetapatti in Ganga Valley in the east, Mehrgarh, Kot Diji, and Nausharo in Indus Valley in the northwest; Lothal and Dholavira in the west. The material testimonies of these excavations have shown gradual cultural developments from the 7th-6th millennium BC in the entire region of Indus-Saraswati-Ganga system for a period of almost 8000 years  Thus archaeology is also supporting the astronomical, ecological and anthropological conclusions that Aryans were originals of India, they have been creating and nurturing a continuously developing civilisation for the last 10,000 years. (c) The anthropological research reports have established that DNA dating for paleolithic continuity starts from 60,000 BC. The Genome studies during the Holocene have revealed that the genetic profile of humans settled in north, south, east and west of india is same and has remained the same for the last more than 11,000 years. (d) All these multidisciplinary scientific research reports, presented during the seminar, prima facie establish that indigenous civilization has been developing in India for last 10,000 years. This report is on the website of Institute. I think these facts would satisfy the editors on time period of Rigveda and Vedic Period.[[User:Sudhirkbhargava|Sudhirkbhargava]] ([[User talk:Sudhirkbhargava|talk]]) 16:56, 9 January 2013 (UTC)
::::Another finding on dating of Indian Civilization, "on the basis of radio-metric dates from [[Bhirrana]] ([[Haryana]]), the cultural remains of the pre-harappan horizon go back to 7390 BC to 6201 BC".

I had attended the seminar and participated in questions-answer sessions. You'll find from the list that most of the presenters in the seminar were Ph.Ds. You'll find from the report that former President of India, Mr. Abdul Kalam, a known Vedic scholar himself, Mr. Sircar, then Secretary (Culture), GOI and Mr. Pawan Bansal, Cabinet Minister, GOI, also participated in the seminar.

::The report is concensus after peer-review only, as I explained above. Each participant is highly acclaimed in his field. You said Kulbhushan Mishra's paper is irrelevent to you. It is amusing to me. Mr. Misra is an eminent archaeologist and wrote this artical on paintings which are more than 10,000 years old.The analysis of paintings tell us many things about the jewellery, wearings, styles etc. of that period. It is relevent to us, the researchers. His work was published in a reputed journal as you mentioned above. [[Bhimbetka]], a [[World Heritage Site]], also has similar paintings. Some other sites about 10,000 years old as mentioned earlier are [[Bhirrana]], [[Mehrgarh]], [[Jhusi]]. You mentioned JRSharma's one paper, I know about many which are published in Journals. Each presenter in the seminar is highly respected and report is scientific. I have a plethora of papers from various seminars in India and US, but I do not think that there is any use of putting them here.

::::A number of problems here, but the main issue is still [[WP:REDFLAG]]. I'm not sure if we should be discussing this here, but civilization requires cities, not just signs, for instance, of agriculture. I can understand people wanting to define it otherwise, but for archaeological and historical purposes there are some criteria that have to be met - public buildings, a class structure, etc. Note that huge as it was, even Çatalhöyük is described as a settlement (or sometimes village), not a city. There are cave painting much older than 10,000 years old. Then there is of course the religious issue - we don't know what religion the people of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] practiced. We are not going to suddenly try to turn over the mainstream view in our articles because of this. I'll also note that archaeology and Indian politics as a combination have produced some highly disputed results before. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sources, and we do not have those.

We used to have an article on this. See [[User:Dbachmann/Wikipedia and nationalism/Hindutva and pseudoscience]]. It may be time to revive the topic. See also [[Scientific foreknowledge in the Vedas]], [[Historiography and nationalism]].
This is the topic you are looking at here. One thing this has certainly nothing to do with whatsoever is an actual scholarly evaluation of the date of the Rigveda. You are free to believe the Rigveda was composed by ancient aliens, but please do not waste Wikipedia's time with your views. The Rigveda depicts a society of the late Bronze Age. They have wheeled chariots and metal swords. I.e. the oldest hymns remember the earliest arrival of the Indo-Aryans, as reflected by the [[Gandhara culture]].
You might as well claim that the Iliad dates to 8000 BC, but you should not expect that anyone will think you worth listening to. See also [[WP:RANDY]]. --[[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|(𒁳)]]&lt;/small&gt; 09:35, 14 January 2013 (UTC)

::I want to be quite open minded while making discussions on dating of Rigveda and Vedic Period. A prize winning historian, [[Upinder Singh]] in book 'A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India:From the Stone Age to the 12th Century', on page 116,published in 2008, talks of finding of Copper manufacturing units of various small items like arrowheads, fishhooks in Ganeshwar-Jodhpura in [[Sikar]] district of [[Rajasthan]] belonging to three stages 3800BCE, 2800 BCE, 2600 BCE. In fact 80 Copper sites have been located in the area, and it is assumed [[Harrapa]] habitations have been importing their Copper items from this area. This was pre-bronze period. Though, the writer did not link it with Vedic period, but other sources do. Palaeobotanical findings on the [[Saraswati]] river route confirm habitations during 7000 BCE. Flood period seers and their contribution remains the base of new researches. Much more is in pipe line to convince those who are interested in Indian ancient history. I do feel that Wikipedia editors should mention the new researches on respective pages.[[User:Sudhirkbhargava|Sudhirkbhargava]] ([[User talk:Sudhirkbhargava|talk]]) 09:04, 15 January 2013 (UTC)
:::None of this of course suggests a 10000 year old civilization.

[[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 06:19, 17 January 2013 (UTC)
:::Quite true. The other issue, just as important in its way, is the linguistic origins of the people who composed the Vedas (at whatever exact date they were composed). It's an extreme fringe view that those people were in India, or anywhere near it, 10000 years ago (see [[Indigenous Aryans]]); a more generally accepted view is that they were approaching India from the northwest, roughly 3500 years ago (see [[Indo-Aryan migration]]). For that reason, to call an Indian culture of 10000 years ago "Vedic" is pushing the fringe view. [[User talk:Andrew Dalby|Andrew Dalby]] 09:54, 17 January 2013 (UTC)
::After the great floods, 10,000 years ago  [[Manusmriti]] was composed, consisting of about 2685 shaloks (verses). As mentioned in Sanskrit Books of that period,  Manu, and his adopted son [[Bhrigu]] had guided/sermoned the congregation of flood ravaged seers on the subject of 'organised way of living' in the Vedic state of Brahmavarta on the banks of revered Vedic river Saraswati. The book was considered a 'Law Book' for Hindus by the British rulers, especially by [[Sir William Jones]] the indologist and  the language expert from Britain who came to India to translate the book and to frame rules for governing Hindu Indians by East India Company, in 1770s. Manusmriti shows that it was not a stone age culture, people were civilised and sages and seers who attended the conference were advised on organising the society for better administration, by dividing the community in four vernas (groups) as per their knowledge. Different sections were allotted jobs and responsibility as per their knowledge of Vedas. This four Verna division was seen during [[Ramayana]] period of 5114-5180 BCE and [[Mahabharata]] period of 3100 BCE  as well. Similarly, the Vedic spiritual Gods, [[Shiva]] ( mentioned as Rudra in Rigved) with three different identities, his [[Parvati]] or  Rudrani with nine different identities and son [[Ganesha]] were devised by the flood time seers which are worshiped even at present times by all shades of Hindus throughout the country in one form or the other. These spiritual Gods and Godesses are a good example of the fact that Vedic Seers had good knowledge of Cosmic energies, and their effect on human brain and how peace and tranquility could be achieved through Yog and Meditation. The flood area where Manu and Bhrigu's hermitage were located was on [[Rajasthan]]-[[Haryana]] border, from where flood time [[Saraswati]] river had flown,  and not in [[Sindhu]] river area as it is made out to be. There are several copper articals, archaeological and palaeobotanical findings in this area to confirm above facts. These facts earlier were written by me on talk pages of [[Vedic Period]] and [[Ayurved]] also. I wonder when these facts will find place on different pages in Wikipedia.[[User:Sudhirkbhargava|Sudhirkbhargava]] ([[User talk:Sudhirkbhargava|talk]]) 11:06, 19 January 2013 (UTC)

== Sourcing demand concerning geographical term in a human genetics related article ==

'''Relevant Wikipedia article:''' [[Talk:Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)]]

'''Edit proposal under dispute:'''
Note that the following is from a lead paragraph, which is summarizing (as usual) something basic about the subject which is discussed in detail within the article body. There is no dispute about the details in the body, only how to summarize them.

|E-M215 has two subclades: E-M35 and E-M281, but of these only E-M35 is known to occur outside of the [[Horn of Africa]], and it also dominates the modern E-M215 population in that region. In modern populations, E-M35 is most frequently found in the Horn of Africa, and in [[North Africa]]. While several variants of E-M215 are only found in the Horn of Africa, some specific types are common in [[East Africa]] as far south as South Africa, or scattered throughout the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]].

'''Summary of reasoning for the two proposals, and the need for community comment:''' 
*138.88.60.165 wants all references to "Horn of Africa" should be changed to "East Africa" because this is the exact term used in a series of related genetics articles made by one team of Italian geneticists, to describe a part of the world where E-M215 is common, and where it has several variants that have never been seen elsewhere. (They are referring to data which is almost entirely from Ethiopia.) 138.88.60.165's is reverting edits with edit comments that claim that 138.88.60.165 is waiting for answers to sourcing demands concerning this matter. 
*Andrew Lancaster (posting here) believes that although those Italian papers are indeed important sources for the body of our article (but not the only sources), they are not reliable sources for '''novel English geographical terminology''' to be used when summarizing their work in a Wikipedia lead. In particular, it is proposed that both the sources named below, and the body of our article makes it clear, in a well-sourced and un-disputed way, that E-M215 is not very frequent south of the Horn of Africa at all, and the "several variants of E-M215 [which] are only found in East Africa" were in fact only ever seen in Ethiopia. So this is a question of picking good wording, and the proposed wording change simply gives the wrong message, which can surely not be the right thing to do. In summary I think the sourcing challenge being made by 138.88.60.165 seems to be an incorrect way to interpret WP sourcing requirements - by extending it to a word choice issue, and even using it in order to push for less accurate wording.

'''Sources which 138.88.60.165 is claiming as being the relevant reliable sources for the geographical terminology:'''

These are all by the same team, and use the same core data pool of genetic samples.

::Comnparing the maps respectively of [[East Africa]] and [[Horn of Africa]] one can see at a glance that the former extends south as far as Burundi and Madagascar, where E-M215  is infrequent, and several varieties restricted in fact to that part of the Horn of Africa which is Ethiopia. Though the Horn of Africa is a subset of East Africa, what should be decisive here on the English wikipedia is how English usage determines the denotation, and in English East Africa connotes in particular the area covered by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, which is outside the range where E-M215 is concentrated.

To be more precise, I am asking for sources to figure out the most commonly used name for the region that E-M215 is spread in, I am not asking for opinions and beliefs. I have provided (see E-M215 Talk page) not only the authoritative sources that Andrew Lancaster has shown above, but also names for the region used by the main commercial private DNA testing companies, and in all cases what is used is East Africa and I can not even find ONE case where the Horn of Africa terminology is being used for the region in this context. In addition, I am also asking for some consistency in the Article, it shows the E-M215 lineage as originating in East Africa for instance, why are different terminologies being used across the article when it is the same dataset that was used to arrive at both the conclusions of origin and spread ?

:So you are arguing that the term Horn of Africa is a geographical term which is only used outside of human genetics studies? Please clarify. Also perhaps consider Semino et al and Luis et al and so on and so on, who do use the terms in exactly such contexts. In fact all your sources stem from this ''one'' Italian data set name only, and I think the author team in Rome would find it odd to see you trying to use their dataset name as a source for a unique way of using the English term East Africa!

::If this boils down to East Africa vs Horn of Africa, it doesn't so much matter to my mind that authors whose native language is not English say East Africa, To my mind Horn of Africa is more specific and more accurate and therefore would be better to use. Does Italian even have an equivalent term to Horn of Africa? If we are especially talking about Ethiopia and surrounding regions I think Horn of Africa is clearer, more specific, and better.

:::I agree with that. Italian ''does'' in fact have an equivalent term [[:it:Corno d'Africa]] but the only sources cited on that Italian wiki page are English. It's worth remembering that while English speakers, saying "East Africa", would think first of Kenya and neighbours (colonial memories: also known once upon a time as "British East Africa"), Italian speakers would think first of Somalia and Ethiopia (colonial memories: also known once upon a time as "Italian East Africa"). To be clear and exact in English, it is better to say "the Horn of Africa". [[User talk:Andrew Dalby|Andrew Dalby]] 09:58, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

::::I don't think this has anything to do with British or Italian, it is an issue of geography primarily and not necessarily geopolitics. For instance I have provided 3 commercial American sources that provide private DNA testing also using the East Africa terminology for the region where this lineage is spread in. I have also cited another Author, Scheinfeldt (2010), again a non-Italian that uses the Eastern Africa terminology for the origin of the lineage. The last source shown by Andrew Lancaster above, Henn (2008), Which is a paper on a specific variant of E-M35 that is more concentrated in the parts of East Africa that is South of Ethiopia, does not even mention the Horn of Africa as a terminology even once, but rather uses specific country names (Ethiopia and Somalia), hence Why I did not object when Andrew Lancaster added the specification of Ethiopian in the lead. 
::::So the reasons why no sources are being provided for the use of this terminoloyg, Horn of Africa, in this context is simple, BECAUSE SUCH SOURCES DO NOT EXIST, I think it is just easier to admit this.
::::The other issue that I mentioned that needs to be addressed is that of uniformity or consistency in the terminology used throughout the entire article.[[Special:Contributions/138.88.60.165|138.88.60.165]] ([[User talk:138.88.60.165|talk]]) 16:25, 13 January 2013 (UTC)
:::::This is a bit silly and has all been discussed (and not answered) on the article talk page. For example the commercial companies are paraphrasing the Italian papers, and [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/suppl.2/8931.full Scheinfeld] does not discuss this subject except for a passing reference to Henn (mentioned above) and the variant of E-M215 found in the southern part of Africa. And yes, Henn et al does not mention the Horn but it is important for being a source of information about the ''rest'' of East Africa (the southern part ). That particular article makes it absolutely clear that we should ''not'' be implying that East Africa is the same in all parts. It is only one part, the northern part including Somalia and Ethiopia, which has an extremely high level of E-M215, as discussed in many more articles as well, some of which such as Semino et al do mention the Horn by name.
:::::''All this is beside the point in my opinion.'' I have proposed, and everyone seems to agree, that we do not need to follow one article concerning ''a clear English word'' which would include the region of Ethiopia and Somalia, but exclude places like Tanzania and Mozambique. We just need to look in any basic reference work. We do not normally even need to give a source for normal English terms. We also do not need to be "consistent" in the sense of the demand above (using the same term to refer to a region where E-M215 is common, and where it is thought to have originated; these are two different subjects). Is there anyone who thinks I am wrong on this?

::::::First of all, let us all try to get our facts correct before we speak or try to make our case, Scheinfeldt (2010) is certainly not referring to Henn(2008) but to Semino (2004), which, surprise surprise, does not mention even ONCE the terminology Horn of Africa in their paper, "Origin, Diffusion, and Differentiation of Y-Chromosome Haplogroups E and J: Inferences on the Neolithization of Europe and Later Migratory Events in the Mediterranean Area" , Instead what do they refer to the East African region where E-M35 and its variants are frequently spread, well see for yourself:
:::::::"E-M78 (fig. 1E) is present in Europe, the Middle East, and North and '''East Africa.'''"
:::::::"Both phylogeography and microsatellite variance suggest that E-P2 and its derivative, E-M35, probably originated in '''eastern Africa'''."etc....

:::::::I disagree with this, for example the irrelevant cherry picking ("is present in" and "originated in" are NOT what we are writing about in the paragraph you keep changing), but it would be a waste of time to go any further about all the genetics articles, because the relevance of the genetics articles to this word choice is still the open question: ''Why'' does a Wikipedia editor need to look at a genetics article to describe the region which includes Ethiopia and Somalia, but not any of the parts of East Africa to the south?

::::::::Reverts continuing, but no more responses on talk pages. Currently there are only 3 editors active in a cycle of reverts on this article (me and another who want Horn of Africa, plus the IP). This is just a simple summary paragraph in the lead, trying to say roughly where E-M215 is common, but leads are important. It has become harder to see where it is most common since this article had two "daughters". I have tried several round of wording tweaks also in order to try to get out of this, but we seem to be stuck with a dead horse flogging situation. (For example, the alternative idea to name the exact large ethnic groups known to have highest frequencies, for example &gt;50%, such as Somalians and Berbers, is called "cherry picking". The IP wants "East Africa" apparently because, if you see above, said IP believes the place where E-M215 is common must be where it originated millenia ago?)

::::::::: Are you suggesting that the area of origin for E-M215/M35 is different from the area that we are arguing about in this context? i.e., the East African area where E-M215 is more frequently spread in.[[Special:Contributions/138.88.60.165|138.88.60.165]] ([[User talk:138.88.60.165|talk]]) 15:49, 14 January 2013 (UTC)
:::::::::: Absolutely. Recall that the original text you accused of ethnic cherry-picking did not use the term Horn of Africa. It distinguished several large ethno-linguistic groups. Somali people have an extremely high frequency, but unlike Ethiopia the east of the Horn is a place with very little signs of being the place of origin of E-M215. Place of origin and place with highest frequency are two completely different concepts, and estimated using different information. They are only rarely near each other, and generally that is a coincidence (in this case apparently caused by a more recent Cushitic migration "back" from the direction of Egypt, according to the published authors). Determining place of origin is highly speculative and often controversial, and therefore something Wikipedia editors must be cautious about. So for ''origins'' we quote authors carefully, and have a special section in the body. But place of highest modern frequency is something you can read from a data table, and is just a straightforward fact we can report. To repeat: leads have very basic aims. When someone comes to article they will want to know what sort of thing the subject is, and where you find it. Discussion of the possible origin point is much more complex and needs to be handled in the body, as it currently is. '''Summary''': ''There is absolutely no reason that we should be forcing our description of where E-M215 is most common to be "consistent" with the place where some authors have suggested that it might have originated''.--[[User:Andrew Lancaster|Andrew Lancaster]] ([[User talk:Andrew Lancaster|talk]]) 16:11, 14 January 2013 (UTC)
:::::::::::I STRONGLY disagree, the authors arrived at a possible area of origin for E-M215/M35 using reason and a specific dataset, it was not magic, here are the reasons they thought why this lineage originated where it did:
::::::::::::"Several observations point to eastern Africa as the homeland for haplogroup E3b—that is, it had (1) the highest number of different E3b clades (table 1), (2) a high frequency of this haplogroup and a high microsatellite diversity, and, finally, (3)the exclusive presence of the undifferentiated E3b* paragroup." 
:::::::::::All the 3 reasons point to the same area of East Africa that we are arguing about, which you insist on calling the Horn of Africa when it is about frequency but want to call it East Africa when it is about origin, I on the other hand insist on leaving it as just East Africa CONSISTENTLY. The same reasoning used by the authors to identify the East African homeland of E-M215 is the same reason the Wikipedia article is showing East Africa as a 'possible place of origin' for E-M215. I am not sure how much clearer it can get than this really. [[Special:Contributions/138.88.60.165|138.88.60.165]] ([[User talk:138.88.60.165|talk]]) 16:55, 14 January 2013 (UTC)
:::::::::::::This is nonsensical. The authors you quote are discussed in exactly this way in the ''origins'' section of the body of our article. '''They are reliable sources for this origins proposal, clearly''', and this is a complicated subject which it would probably be WP:OR for us to "reverse engineer" too much. However, even allowing this line of attack, ''not one'' of the 3 reasons you cite concerning their origins proposal is the same as "''region of highest frequency''", i.e. region where you are most likely to come across someone who is positive for E-M215. You keep saying this is a sourcing issue, but ''not once have you cited any author who says anything which conflicts with saying that E-M215 is most common in "North Africa and the Horn of Africa"''. This is just a basic summary of what the data in the article says. And in fact you ''clearly know'' that Henn et al and other surveys show that the rest of East Africa is not such a place. Your wording demands would force us to say that E-M215 is at its most common in places like Tanzania '''in modern populations''', when you know very well that this is '''not true''', and has nothing to do with speculations about ancient populations!

As you can see, my proposal stays pretty much the same, except for the addition of specifics on E-M293 and E-M78, which I hesitantly accepted, because it is not just E-M78 that is present in the Middle East, but also E-M123, in any case ,is this your final proposal or are you going to change it again?

'''Let me try to restate this -''' I think you are getting little comment because of the very technical topic but, if I am reading this correctly, the genetics are irrelevant and the whole dispute centers around what to call a region of Africa. Is that right? A couple of questions:
*Is there any dispute at all that we are talking about Ethiopia and some of the immediately adjacent regions? 
*These scholarly sources appear highly reliable on questions of genetics -- I'm assuming this is genetics? -- but why would they be authorities on geographical nomenclature?
*Would it solve anything if, when we talk about EM-215's distribution, we quoted one of these studies as saying "E-M35 is found in East Africa and North Africa" (or whatever a satisfactory quote is that contains "East Africa", then say a little later something like "ouside of the Horn of Africa where it most frequently occurs, particular variant have been found as far south as bla bla"? 
I have to say, to me, East Africa is the entire right-hand side of the continent. But if you want to use a geographical designation which, to me, is somewhat wrong, you could put it in a quote -- since the reason for using it is that the authors use  it -- then clarify the facts in the voice of Wikipedia.

If that doesn't help because the dispute is now about something else then please restate the issue. [[User:Elinruby|Elinruby]] ([[User talk:Elinruby|talk]]) 22:14, 15 January 2013 (UTC)

:Hi Elinruby. I agree in any case, and to me it seems all people have posted here think in the same direction. The most recent edits seem to confirm that this IP editor is mostly concerned with avoiding the term "Horn of Africa" even while knowing quite well that it is a standard term, because he/she has proposed on the article talkpage that they can accept a compromise of "the northern part of East Africa". So it never seems to have been a real sourcing problem. Concerning your advice, I think it is good, but this field has a shortage of true secondary sources (the academic articles all do a bit of primary raw data and secondary review work when they appear, because the field is fast moving). So we have no handy source which summarizes as we would wish.

I am almost afraid to point out that the wikilink on "East Africa" leads to an article illustrated by a map that indicates that the term refers to the entire right-hand coast of the continent. Perhaps you could leave the wording as is but remove the somewhat misleading link?

::A significant point (it seems to me) is our duty to paraphrase the sources, not to copy them word-for-word.

The religious movement has a magazine titled, "Joensori" that it publishes that could be used to verify several biographical details about Jung Myung Seok, like his service in Vietnam.

== Erowid a reliable source about drugs or not? ==

[[User:Cantaloupe2|Cantaloupe2]] has removed references to [[Erowid]] from the page [[List of misconceptions about illegal drugs]], with the edit summary: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Erowid is a collection of anecdotal evidence and it is not a reliable source and does not belong here, period.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_misconceptions_about_illegal_drugs&amp;curid=11840866&amp;diff=533672700&amp;oldid=533102756 diff]. 

I'm not sure if this is true. None of the links go to user experiences, but to various articles and FAQs. Links to other sites, such as acsa2000.net, canorml.org and ncbi.nlm.nih.gov were also removed. I'm confused. Is Erowid an RS in this context, and what about the other sites removed? --&lt;span style="text-shadow:#FFD700 0.2em 0.2em 0.2em"&gt;[[User:Auric|&lt;font color="#FC3700"&gt;'''Auric'''&lt;/font&gt;]]  [[User talk:Auric|&lt;font color="#0C0F00"&gt;''talk''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:36, 18 January 2013 (UTC)

:Yes, I did remove some credible references to, because, the prose that went with the references did not summarize what they said. This is the part I removed, in addition to all Erowid references: 

:"A cannabis equivalent of a hangover may occur the morning after taking high doses, but even that ends much sooner than the legend suggests. While someone who smokes cannabis on Friday night would most likely come out positive in a urine test on Monday morning, he would no longer actually be impaired by that point." [http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_effects.shtml Cannabis Effects by Erowid] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12373420&amp;dopt=AbstractCurranCurran NIH.GOV]

:NIH hosted journal does not advance the position that this is in any way similar to hang over or if if this is in fact a well established legend. Erowid is bunk when it comes to 99.999% of anything. I explained why I removed Erowid and cited the prior [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_138#Erowid discussion] in talk page. When Erowid does not attribute, its difficult to validate what they're saying. If they're republishing reliable sources in verbatim in a significant amount, we can't permit that either, because that's [[WP:COPYVIO|copyright violation]]. These same concerns were addressed in prior discussion in December. [[User:Cantaloupe2|Cantaloupe2]] ([[User talk:Cantaloupe2|talk]]) 07:22, 20 January 2013 (UTC)
I think the Wikipedia entry of [[Erowid]] gives many reasons why it is a [[WP:RS]]. As the entry says, Erowid provides much accurate information, and they are frequently cited in [[WP:RS]]s. Furthermore, they've published articles in peer-reviwed medical journals. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=erowid &lt;br&gt;
As for the [[WP:COPYVIO]], how do you know that it's copyright violation and not fair use? That's a decision for a lawyer to make. Are you a lawyer? --[[User:Nbauman|Nbauman]] ([[User talk:Nbauman|talk]]) 07:26, 21 January 2013 (UTC)

:I don't know what to make of that. It looks like Earth Erowid and Fire Erowid are fake names aka internet monikers used by the staff members of Erowid.org so that their last names are namesake with the website. This does not inherit expertise to the website. [http://www.erowid.org/general/about/about_faq.shtml#what_do about]. The [http://www.erowid.org/general/about/about_crew.shtml crew]. 

I don't think Erowid can simply be considered a non [[WP:SOURCES|reliable sources]]. Some pages don't have sources, some a few, and others have many. For example [http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_info3.shtml this] about cannabis has cited sources. Erowid has also been cited [https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&amp;q=site%3Amaps.org+Erowid&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8 many times] by the [[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]], for example see [http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v11n1/11119ero.html this]. Erowid Center has also a project named ecstasydata.org, which tests street-ecstasy tablets to know its content.  

Regarding [[WP:COPYVIO]], that is about including copyright violation content ''in'' the Wikipedia article, not about the references. Many times, references include the URL to PDF archives which are hosted in third party sites, evading the pay-wall of many journals, is that fair use? As Nbauman said, that is a decision for a lawyer to make, any way, that is not [[WP:COPYVIO]], bacause it is not content in a WP article, it is a reference. --[[User:KDesk|KDesk]] ([[User talk:KDesk|talk]]) 18:30, 21 January 2013 (UTC)

:Distributing copyrighted work to circumvent payment is the very essence of copyright infringement. Did you read the prior RSN discussion on Erowid which I linked earlier?  See [[WP:ELNEVER]]. Per policy, URLs to pirated contents are prohibited. [[User:Cantaloupe2|Cantaloupe2]] ([[User talk:Cantaloupe2|talk]]) 20:32, 21 January 2013 (UTC)

::[[WP:ELNEVER]] is the right link, especially for evading pay-walls, thanks. Any way, how can we know what Erowid does is fair use, or if they have permissions or no? I've seen the past discussion on Erowid, but for articles with are sourced (not copied), why not include them? --[[User:KDesk|KDesk]] ([[User talk:KDesk|talk]]) 21:42, 22 January 2013 (UTC)

*'''Source''': [http://www.slowtwitch.com/ www.slowtwitch.com], specically [http://www.slowtwitch.com/aboutus.html Technical Editor Greg Kopecky]
*'''Article''': [[Sheldon Brown (bicycle mechanic)]]
*'''Content''': "chain cleaning, lubrication and wear, a source of controversy in the field of bicycle maintenance."
The point, that chain maintenance is controversial, is already [http://sheldonbrown.com/chains.html confirmed by Brown], who has previously been [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_139#Sheldon_Brown.27s_personal_website_for_bicycle_related_topics confirmed to be a reliable source], so it seems that www.slowtwitch.com should be fine for independent confirmation. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASheldon_Brown_%28bicycle_mechanic%29&amp;diff=533911402&amp;oldid=533894676 There is a claim] that www.slowtwitch.com is [[wp:sps|self-published]], and so inherently unreliable, but I can find no indication of that. It was founded in 1999 by [[Dan Empfield]] and provides bios of its contributors, including Technical Editor Greg Kopecky. It has a global Alexa Traffic Rank of 35,263 compared to 11,633 for BikeRadar.com, 19,330 for Bicycling.com, 179,646 for BikeMag.com, and 1,151,976 for VeloNews.com. [http://www.bicycleretailer.com/north-america/2008/04/29/slowtwitch-hires-prasuhn-senior-editor#.UPwBRycjVQA Here] is an article in ''Bicycle Retailer and Industry News'' about slowtwitch hiring a senior editor. What say ye? -[[User:AndrewDressel|AndrewDressel]] ([[User talk:AndrewDressel|talk]]) 23:37, 19 January 2013 (UTC)

:The disagreement is specifically over this [http://www.slowtwitch.com/Tech/Chain_How-To_-_Part_1_3279.html article]. "why is there so much controversy?" is a hook, and the explanation offered is not journalism, but his personal opinion as evidenced by copious use of first person pronouns in the article. So, to evaluate if the statement that there is indeed controversy in the industry, I evaluated if he's an establish author. He received a press coverage for somewhat controversial incident in what appears to be him initiating a frivolous legal claim against a city [http://www.gazette.com/articles/city-120117-bicyclist-parked.html here] which is a challenge to accuracy of his claim. There is no established publications by him which swears him in as expert, so his OPINION should not be used as a support another's opinion. [[User:Cantaloupe2|Cantaloupe2]] ([[User talk:Cantaloupe2|talk]]) 23:48, 19 January 2013 (UTC)

::I can find no mention of writing style in the [[wp:rs|reliable source]] guidelines, nor any mention of how unrelated events in an author's personal life bear upon their reliability in their field of expertise. -[[User:AndrewDressel|AndrewDressel]] ([[User talk:AndrewDressel|talk]]) 00:03, 20 January 2013 (UTC)

:::The writing describes "I/we" experiences and his evaluation of controversial is derived from his opinion. Before an opinion piece on some website can be considered "an expert opinion" so that its beyond "some people say..." territory. The point of disagreement is that someone only known for suing the city for running his bike into the back of a parked truck does not meet the "Self-published '''expert''' sources may be considered reliable when produced by an '''established''' expert on the topic of the article, whose work in the relevant field has previously been '''published by reliable''' third-party publications." Since its an opinion piece, like responses to letter to the editor, I consider this an opinion piece and Kopecky does not appear to meet the standard of established expert. [[User:Cantaloupe2|Cantaloupe2]] ([[User talk:Cantaloupe2|talk]]) 00:14, 20 January 2013 (UTC)

::::There is no indication, however, that the articles by slowtwitch staff are self-published any more than the articles by the staff of any other news outlet, so the [[WP:NEWSORG]] guidelines should apply, not the self-publish guidelines. Also, the article in question, although written in a conversational style, is about chain maintenance and not an "opinion piece". For similar examples of news stories in more-traditional publications that describe something as controversial, consider the story on page 18 of today's NY Times on [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/rift-widens-over-mining-uranium-in-virginia.html?hp&amp;_r=0 uranium mining in Virginia], which states "A fight over whether to drill ... has divided the region", or the story on page 6 in the same paper about [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/world/asia/in-china-discontent-among-the-normally-faithful.html?ref=world discontent in China], which states "A widening discontent was evident this month". Would either of those articles be considered opinion pieces, or would they be considered reliable sources to reference claims of controversy? Could [[Uranium_mining_in_the_United_States#Virginia]] state that uranium mining in Virginia is controversial with that article as a source, or would it have to say that Trip Gabriel of the New York Times claims that it is controversial? I do not mean to suggest that slowtwitch.com is equivalent to the NY Times, but merely to demonstrate that an article from a news source making the non-exceptional claim that something is controversial without citing a study published in a peer-reviewed journal as confirmation does not automatically make that article an opinion piece. -[[User:AndrewDressel|AndrewDressel]] ([[User talk:AndrewDressel|talk]]) 15:55, 20 January 2013 (UTC)

* This has little to do with the reliability of Greg Kopecky and far more to do with the question of whether Cantaloupe2 has crossed the line from [[WP:TENDENTIOUS]] to outright [[WP:TROLL]]. Just look at the recent article history. Also what is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sheldon_Brown_%28bicycle_mechanic%29&amp;diff=533909178&amp;oldid=533895272 this edit summary] about? Is Cantaloupe's contention now (having been defeated on every other complaint) that someone who is awarded damages against a city / suffers a fractured skull / cycles negligently (I don't know which of these three he thinks disqualifies a source) is no longer an acceptable source?  [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 18:32, 20 January 2013 (UTC)

*When a source calls  something "controversial", it is often  a mere rhetorical device to introduce a topic. Journalists need to present things in some pattern, and pro-and-con is one of the standards. Typically, if a writer wishes to do other than present a straight description of the facts in chronological sequence, there needs to be some focus, and human argument is a good one to hold the interest of the reader, because people cannot read an argument without taking sides to some extent, even if the matter does not directly concern them. This extends to WP also: essentially everything in human affairs is a matter of argument, because it affects humans, and affects different groups or individuals differently, and so they fight about it. Perhaps we would do well to eliminate the word as much as possible. In general , finding a source or failing to find one that says something is "controversial" is a meaningless exercise.

== Waldorf education: two sources ==

*Article: [[Waldorf education]]

*Source 1: Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädogogik'', ''Kölner Veröffentlichungen zur Religionsgeschichte'', v. 27. Böhlau Verlag, ISBN 3-412-16700-2. See "Ganzheitliche Erziehung", 2.3.3"
*Content: According to professor Carlo Willmann{{spaced ndash}}a member of the Waldorf education unit at [[Danube University Krems]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/de/studium/waldorfpaedagogik/11356/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}elementary schools center around a multi-disciplinary arts-based curriculum that includes [[visual arts]], [[drama]], artistic movement ([[eurythmy]]), vocal and instrumental [[music]], and crafts.

More generally, all RSs that have any connection to Waldorf education are being contested as sources for this article, even if their work appears in peer-reviewed journals or presses. For example, 
*Source 2: Robert McDermott, The Essential Steiner, Harper San Francisco 1984 ISBN 0-06-065345-0

:Benn: journalist book, not expert educationist, OK for uncontroversial facts. FT: good for news fact only. Ullrich: good source. Rather than the lede saying "it's controversial", which is not informative, it should summarise the detail in the "Responses" section. It doesn't need to introduce new sources. The article needs some copyedits by the way. [[User:Itsmejudith|Itsmejudith]] ([[User talk:Itsmejudith|talk]]) 07:54, 23 January 2013 (UTC)

:Fox News argues that they have both news and opinion journalists and that there is some separation between the two. I'm not completely convinced by this, but Fox has employed some highly respected correspondents - for instance [[Major Garrett]], now at the National Journal. I don't think that we can take something reported on, say, The O'Reilly Factor as a reliable source, but I'm not sure we can automatically dismiss something from, say, Fox's White House correspondent. In this case we're looking at a story that repeatedly mentions that it was produced by foxnews.com. It would be helpful if someone could explain the editorial policies and reputation of that website, since I don't read it, but my sense is that we should treat it like we treat a journalistic article published in ''[[The Nation]]'' or ''[[Mother Jones]]''. My understanding is that in those cases we acknowledge that the publication has a strong editorial position but that their journalistic work is generally well-respected and we look at articles on a case-by-case basis. In this case, it seems like the facts can be sourced to other news organizations.[[User:GabrielF|GabrielF]] ([[User talk:GabrielF|talk]]) 02:42, 22 January 2013 (UTC) 
Yes, you have accused me of removing templates. But that's beside the point. I'm all for discussion of why Fox News is an unreliable source. I'm very puzzled why you've tried to "tell on me" as if we're two kids in a playground. There was ample evidence in the RfC for Fox News that at the '''very least''', it's a highly questionable source to use, even if some of the things it says are factually correct.

:::::::::We're beating a dead horse here, and I'll beat it some more: Bill O'Reilly (or that other one before him, Glenn Beck) is not a reliable source, even if Fox is. Judging whether something is reliable is ''obviously'' a matter of some editorial concern and deliberate evaluation. A blanket statement like "Fox is reliable" is simply incorrect: not everything on Fox is to be accepted (and that goes for other stations as well, of course). I'm not defending everything the IP did, but I certainly don't want to defend everything DS did. A better response would have been to investigate the issue, which in this case would mean learning who Bill O'Reilly is, and learning that differentiation is important. If DS had, for instance, restored everything but O'Reilly, they'd be on firmer ground. "I don't know who Bill O'Reilly is" makes DS's position extraordinarily weak, even if it doesn't make the IP's position any stronger (Collect, I certainly agree with your second sentence). Andrew Dalby, '''we are all anonymous here'''.

We'd be much worse off without them. This is just a little thing you become aware of when you've watched for a while: an occasional anonymous IP edit will be the removal of a useful source reference or a useful name. If you make an edit like that with a named account, people might well come and ask you why you did it. If you make it with an IP address, there's usually no comeback.

::: From Dabangg 2 Talk Page: Film Fail Awards are a reliable source as a panel of esteemed critics decided them. Golden Kela, Ghanta, Screen and Filmfare all had public voting and are considered reliable sources. As long as they're talked about in the media and are affiliated with reliable sources like Rajeev Masand (CNN-IBN), Anirudhha Guha (DNA India), Baradwaj Rangan (The Hindu), Mihir Fadnavis (Mid-Day), Raja Sen (Rediff), and Rituparna Chatterjee (also CNN-IBN) it's RS. Look here: http://filmfailawards.com/jury/ . We had this discussion during the Ghantas and Kela debate and this was decided. Film Fail awards have more credibility than the Kelas which Zee supported and which aren't even affiliated with any critic and also have public voting. You cannot be the judge of what is RS, we have to abide by Wikipedia rules. Zee did not bother to read the jury section or even open the about section.

== [[Yukio Mishima bibliography]]: Number of works ==

I'm asking for someone who brought this up in the IRC help channel. At the article, there seems to be a dispute on the number of works Mishima has created, attributed to different sources. [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yukio_Mishima_bibliography&amp;diff=534144766&amp;oldid=534119423 This diff] shows the discrepancies. I don't have access to any of the sources and I'm unsure how to proceed, so I'd appreciate it if the folks here could help. Thanks. [[User:Wctaiwan|wctaiwan]] ([[User talk:Wctaiwan|talk]]) 11:43, 21 January 2013 (UTC)
: Without access to any of the sources it's difficult to tell whether this is an actual disagreement among experts (after all, when is it a book of connected short stories and when is it an episodic novel?), a mistake, or merely vandalism. The editor [[User:みしまるもも|みしまるもも]] seems sincere, but he seems to be in the minority. I found this: http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/25/specials/mishima-bios.html which also says 40 novels. I also worry that his point seems to be whether or not a novel was written for profit, or for entertainment, which isn't normally the way literary experts make decisions - there are plenty of novels that weren't written to make money, and there are also plenty of novels that were written to enlighten or to preach rather than to entertain. I'm also worried that he seems to be basing his edits on a "complete works" edition, and yet still writes "about" - you'd think with a complete works edition he could simply count. Without better evidence than that, I'd recommend reverting or, at best, putting a footnote: "such and such complete works edition only lists 34 novels." --[[User:GRuban|GRuban]] ([[User talk:GRuban|talk]]) 15:31, 22 January 2013 (UTC)

Hi, Mr. GRuban. Henry Scott-Strokes said that Mishima wrote 40 novels, and 18 plays etc., but it isn't right clearly. "18 plays" is too little number.  And actually, Mishima wrote 34 novels.  I've list up all his 34 novels in [[Yukio Mishima bibliography]].  Please see.  Then, my "about"(number of plays and books of short stories) means that how include Mishima's childhood works, or unpublished or unfinished stories and plays, or include the luxurious limited editions.  So, it is necessary to attach "about" word.  It is important to show more precisely about Mishima's works.　Sorry for my poor english. --[[User:みしまるもも|みしまるもも]] ([[User talk:みしまるもも|talk]]) 01:46, 23 January 2013 (UTC)
: I can't argue with you directly, as I personally don't have an alternate list of Mishima's works. However, I do see many other sources saying 40 novels.

:: Also I don't know Henry Scott-Strokes, but our article [[Henry Scott Stokes]] has him as a professional journalist for some respected newspapers, a personal friend of Mishima, and the author of a published biography of Mishima.

Hi, Mr. GRuban.  
Of course, Henry Scott Stokes is an excellent journalist, and is a Mishima's good friend.  But Henry do not show list of 40 novels in it, and other newspaper sources do not too.  Number of plays "18" is too little.  It is wrong cleary  Henry researced details about [[Tatenokai]], and relations with Mishima and [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], but he is not a researcher of Mishima's literature.  "Final edition-Yukio Mishima complete works"(No.1 - No.42 plus 2) [http://www.shinchosha.co.jp/zenshu/mishima_yukio/] [http://www.ne.jp/asahi/yamazaki/kasetsuhome/study/mishimatxt.htm] are classified into Novels, Short Stories, Plays, Criticisms (include Essays etc.),  These are published by [[Shinchosha]].  A lot of Mishima's works were published by Shinchosha in ｄuring his life time too.  And this "Final edition"'s editors are experts in research of Mishima's iterature.  Actually, Mishima's novels are 34.  None of Japanese researcher of Mishima say "Mishima wrote 40 novels".  Where are 6 (40-34) novels?   Mishima's all novels are recorded in No.1 - No.14.  Please see [http://www.ne.jp/asahi/yamazaki/kasetsuhome/study/mishimatxt.htm] , and please count it.

:Graham Greene distinguished between his own novels and his own mere "entertainments", if I remember correctly; and even the (at his best) excellent (and Nobel-winning) Kawabata also knocked out forgettable stuff for the money. There could be a legitimate distinction between (A) a novel rightly considered part of a writer's real oeuvre (pardon the pretentious word) and (B) a lower order of novel. And there are other imaginable complications too. I'm not much impressed by flat statements that a writer wrote ''N'' novels, because (quality aside) I can see immediate problems with the simple/simplistic numbering of the novels by those authors whose work I happen to enjoy. (E.g. Nabokov: is his ''The Eye'' a novel or a mere novella, and should his ''The Enchanter'' be counted at all?) &amp;para; This seems to be an excellent opportunity for thinking editors to use reliable sources ''and'' their own brains, and work together to come up with intelligent numbers. I've written at greater length at [[Talk:Yukio Mishima bibliography]], and suggest that the conversation should continue there rather than here. -- [[User:Hoary|Hoary]] ([[User talk:Hoary|talk]]) 03:57, 24 January 2013 (UTC)

:When the prose makes medical claims, such as efficacy, safety, effects, etc, the general guideline is that we must use [[WP:MEDRS]] and cherry picked articles from mainstream media speaking flatteringly of marijuana safety is not appropriate.

:This is not the root of the issue however.

The reference in question (subject of the RfC) is the one remaining reference from that grouping that is still being inserted into the article, most recently today by Cantelope2. All of the experts say no one has ever died from cannabis. The 'flattering prose' are the results of studies which find that cannabis is safer than aspirin. Just do a search to see that the idea anyone has died from cannabis is so fringe it doesn't even exist.

[[WP:MEDRS]] says:  "All Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources. Reliable primary sources may occasionally be used with care as an adjunct to the secondary literature, but there remains potential for misuse." The study, "Acute cardiovascular fatalities following cannabis use," is a primary source. Therefore,  it can't be included in the article. Making a statement like, "people have died from cannabis" and giving ''primary'' sources to support it is original research which is forbidden under [[WP:NOR]].&lt;br&gt;
If these individual primary sources are accurate, somebody should have done an evidence-based review and published it. An evidence-based review is a reliable, published secondary source. If the editor can find a review article, that should go in.

== Kim Jones at About.com on Christian music ==

I have an anon stating that "[http://christianmusic.about.com/od/trivia/a/ccmhistory.htm The Changing Face of Christian Music]", which is on About.com and written by [http://christianmusic.about.com/bio/Kim-Jones-6624.htm Kim Jones] is not a reliable source. It is used three times in the [[:contemporary Christian music]] article
# A direct quote linking the Jesus movement of the early 1970s to the formation of a major Christian music industry, which is supported with other references in the paragraph.
# A similar statement relating how Christian music had, until the late 1960s, been primarily church music.
# A quote indicating that by the Christian bands were crossing-over to non-Christian (mainstream) radio.

Additionally, he has not used the necessary {{citation}} templates where he has admitted they were missing and required due to a lack of verification (those statements are subject to removal). He claims some of the content are [only] in books he owns which is not an acceptable source of verification (original research perhaps). Lastly, he reverted content that he and another user claimed were not properly sourced even though some were from NY Times, MTV.com (music sites), CCM sites and the actual singer's sites verifying the statements he and another user removed. Plus the same content is already found within related articles such as ones about the artists and/or similar topics which "Walter" himself has edited on and/or "watches" (therefore agreeing to it when mentioned on other articles). Not only that, the About.com article includes some of the same musicians I mentioned in the edit that he removed, even though I'm aware it isn't a reliable source (but I provided additional reliable references that he didn't like). It just seems to be a contradition (double-standard). I hope the above users who responded to this source/content not being allowed will finally have it removed.

== Reliable press, outside area of expertise. ==

I recently removed the following ref
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'While population transfers were effected in the Assyrian, Babylonian and Persian periods, most of the indigenous population remained in place. Moreover, after Jerusalem was destroyed in AD 70 the population by and large remained ''in situ,'' and did so again after Bar Kochba's revolt in AD 135. When the vast majority of the population became Christian during the Byzantine period, no vast number were driven out, and similarly in the seventh century, when the vast majority became Muslim, few were driven from the land. Palestine has been multi-cultural and multi ethnic from the beginning, as one can read between the lines even in the biblical narrative. Many Palestinian Jews became Christians, and in turn Muslims. Ironically, many of the forebears of Palestinian Arab refugees may well have been Jewish.'[[Michael Prior (theologian)|Michael Prior]],''Zionism and the State of Israel: A Moral Inquiry,'' Psychology Press 1999 p.201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; from the [[Palestinian people]] article, due to the fact Micahel Prior is not a historian. It is being claimed on the talk page that because the material was published by Psychology Press, it may be used in the article for information about history, which is outside Prior's expertise. Is this correct? 
&lt;p&gt;And a related question - is it true that anything published by an academic press is considered prima facie reliable? [[User:No More Mr Nice Guy|No More Mr Nice Guy]] ([[User talk:No More Mr Nice Guy|talk]]) 22:42, 24 January 2013 (UTC)
:My reading of [[WP:RS]] leads me to the conclusion that a book is reliable if either the author is an acknowledged expert in the field or if the publisher is a well-respected academic publisher. I see the argument above as one that removes the second condition completely. If only experts in the field are "reliable sources", why mention the publisher at all in [[WP:RS]]? And just to note, Psychology Press is part of the Taylor &amp; Francis group. &lt;small style="border: 1px solid;padding:1px 3px;white-space:nowrap"&gt;'''[[User talk:Nableezy|&lt;font color="#C11B17"&gt;nableezy&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - 22:51, 24 January 2013 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

::Well, Prior is a theologian of biblical theology, so the history of Israel from the time of the Assyrians to the time of the Bar Kochba revolt is hardly completely out of his area of expertise. Moreover, as far as I can tell, what he says in the quoted part  is a fair reflection of mainstream opinion. It's certainly true, even according to Biblical sources, that e.g. the [[Babylonian Captivity]] only affected some parts of the population (mostly upper classes and skilled craftsmen), not the population at large. --[[User:Stephan Schulz|Stephan Schulz]] ([[User talk:Stephan Schulz|talk]]) 23:57, 24 January 2013 (UTC)

It should be noted here that the article, [[Palestinian People]] is not a historical article.  The statement the source is being used to support is the first sentence of the lead defining the subject: ''"The Palestinian people, (Arabic: الشعب الفلسطيني‎, ash-sha‘b al-Filasṭīnī) also referred to as Palestinians (Arabic: الفلسطينيون‎, al-Filasṭīniyyūn), are the modern descendants of people who have lived in Palestine over the centuries and today are largely culturally and linguistically Arab.''" 
The definition of Palestinian People is not a historical question and it is reasonable, in my view, to use experts in a number of scholarly disciplines to give a rounded definition of the topic. [[User:Dlv999|Dlv999]] ([[User talk:Dlv999|talk]]) 23:37, 24 January 2013 (UTC)
:Michael Prior was a professor of Biblical Theology, so no matter how you look at it, the quote is outside his area of expertise.

:I'd imagine that something published by an academic press is likely to be accurate, especially as this seems to broadly fall within the author's field of expertise and (based on my understanding) isn't a controversial statement. However, there have to be much better sources which specialise in the topic which should be referenced instead; we're doing our readers a disservice by directing them to works which aren't focused on the subject. I'd suggest finding a scholarly work on the historical demographics of the region and citing that instead (such a work is also likely to provide additional details or nuances which aren't included in the work in question here which can be used to improve the article).

::There seems to be a misapprehension about what qualifying as a Catholic biblical scholar means. You have to learn the relevant semitic languages, study history because the bible is both historical and historicizing, and, as a theologian interested in the Middle East, this almost invariably entails a comprehensive interest in the history of Christianity and Judaism throughout the long durée of that country. This should never have been raised. I don't know why we are required to make inordinate efforts to document a fairly generic and uncontroversible definition of Palestinians. As I've noted before, comparable pages on peoples show no such obsessive scepticism of the lead definitions, which are rarely sourced, and if they are ([[Jews]]), to take a sister article, the sources all fail the kind of test NMMGG and others keep repeatedly demanding of the Palestinian page (Louis Brandeis, a justice on the Supreme Court: Edward Palmer, a 19th century prof. of Arabic, and Albert Einstein, a physicist).

I posted this so that OTHER users participated and "he" is following me and sticking his nose in what was supposed to be unbias and unrelated to him. I do not want to resolve or discuss it anymore simply because he keeps responding to me in a negative manner and not addressing the concerns on the talk page this is about which asked him to list what was wrong or right about the edit, instead he just removed it all. I am not worried about it anymore, and won't be visiting this topic anymore. I have not even read his responses/input since my last edit. I simply do not care what his "opinion" is after he has made a bad impression on me from the start. I don't deal with people like him, they are toxic/cancer. Again, this can be deleted. I would do it, but i am not tip-toeing around Walter's poor attitude and know he will want to read this when he has nothing better to do, plus i don't want it to seem i am violating any policy (unlike "him").

Another editor raised concerns over the reliability of the source, given its use of 'humorous' language. Since it was published by [[IDG Books]], I think it is enough to support the (non contentious) statement, but if I'm wrong, please chime in. The date is quite old, so that might be a problem. 

My main concern is sourcing in the rest of the article. The game is primarily notable ([[AFAICT]]) for a legal controversy surrounding its code and licensing, and so the article is (perhaps rightly so) devoted almost exclusively to that controversy. Since we mention the owner's name, this intersects with BLP. Many of the available sources are poor.

So far, the article [[GodWars]] is a stub mostly supported by primary sources, and we are trying to improve it and provide serious, secondary sources (the references 2 and 4 are not very good either, but this is the worst). We are having a conversation about it on the talk page, but nobody else is participating so I'm bringing it here. I believe it's worth noting that the other editor has a conflict of interest [[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKaVir&amp;diff=535148413&amp;oldid=534857978]]. The source appears to be a lousy text file, not even signed with a real name but with a nickname (Sunangel). It's hosted on a personal website [http://lorry.org] which doesn't look professional or notable (nothing links to it).

::As a matter of principle, we shouldn't treat txt files different than html. Neither are more secure or less prone to manipulation... they're just different formats. A few possible issues I see with this source include that it's hosted on a personal website (and so not prone to editorial oversite, as some journals, newspapers or books would be), its author's real name isn't readily apparent (perhaps I missed it) except for a pseudonym, and some of the sources cited have to be considered carefully. For instance, one source is "author unknown", and another is KaVir (the author of the subject). None of those compel me to discard this source. It may not be the pinnacle of citations, but we can use it, especially for such uncontroversial claims. For the ''particular'' claim being made, that "GodWars is a family of MUD engines", I would prefer to see a source which used the word "family", rather than a chart from which we could infer it.

== Facebook used as official website in infobox ==

{{La|Eduardo Saverin}}

An editor wants to use Saverin's alleged facebook page as his offficial website in the infobox. I've objected saying there is no way to verify that it's Saverin's facebook page. The other editor is insistent. They also seem to see things I don't, perhaps because they are a facebook user (I am not), but claim that even anyone can see them. Although I think the burden is on the other editor to establish a consensus for using the facebook page ([[WP:BRD]]) and have said so on the talk page, I am not going to battle over it. I looked at the archives of this board, but most of it seems geared to using facebook as a source to support material.--[[User:Bbb23|Bbb23]] ([[User talk:Bbb23|talk]]) 16:41, 27 January 2013 (UTC)

:The argument that the page can't be verified it's his is a bit strange to me - if it ''wasn't'', it suggests someone is actively impersonating the part-owner of a site on that site without anyone having noticed, despite millions of page views. It's a bit like worrying we can't assume [[User:Jimbo Wales]] is, in fact, Jimmy :-). I don't see any reason not to trust its validity.

Here is a social media page for Madonna [https://www.facebook.com/madonna] and here is her official site [http://www.madonna.com] The personal Facebook page of Eduardo Saverin is much less "official" than his professional bio here [http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eduardo-saverin] and no more "official" than another Facebook page that also bears his name [https://www.facebook.com/edusaverin] [[User:USchick|USchick]] ([[User talk:USchick|talk]]) 19:05, 27 January 2013 (UTC)

== Patents as source for invention claims ==

I contend that &lt;s&gt;reliable sources&lt;/s&gt; patents are insufficient sources for claims that a certain person invented something, especially when other inventors are traditionally credited with the invention. I suggest multiple high quality secondary sources are required to establish who invented something in controversial cases.

This matter has been discussed since early December at [[Talk:Integrated circuit#Inventors and Patents]] and concerns [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Integrated_circuit&amp;diff=535223472&amp;oldid=535216873 this edit], and a number of similar edits since early December. The edit claims that one Frances Hugle invented a process for fabricating an IC (that is, integrated circuit). To further clarify, in the "Integrated circuit" article is only about monolithic integrated circuits, and does not cover [[Hybrid integrated circuit]]s. The sources cited are US Patents 3226271 and 2994621. The diff also cites [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Integrated_circuit#Inventors_and_Patents the article's talk page].

I leave it to readers to figure out their favorite way to view patents; the US Patent Office makes them available but you have to jump through hoops to install the right TIFF viewer. [[User:Jc3s5h|Jc3s5h]] ([[User talk:Jc3s5h|talk]]) 21:10, 27 January 2013 (UTC)

:Beware. The issue of a patent is proof that the person to whom it was issued was the person granted the patent and nothing more. It is accepted that no previous evidence existed to the Patent Office at the time of a pre-existing claim. The Catch-22 is quite clear here. Edison got the patent for the light bulb (say, I haven't checked) but that does not mean that Fred Bloggs did not invent it 50 years before and didn't bother to get a patent! (And there's plenty of evidence of people "borrowing" others' inventions for their own profit.) [[User:Emeraude|Emeraude]] ([[User talk:Emeraude|talk]]) 22:27, 27 January 2013 (UTC)

:"I contend that reliable sources are insufficient sources..."

:I think it serves ALL readers to be presented with as complete a picture as we can reliably provide.

:Most secondary sources do credit Noyce and Kilby since their patents were awarded first. But, that is because these sources were unaware that Frances had filed for a patent on the IC years before... ultimately awarded in two parts (in 1961 and in 1965).

:But there was an article printed in SEMI magazine and written by its editorial staff that mentioned Fran invented an early IC while at Baldwin in the fifties and it was for this reason that Baldwin provided the funding for Siliconix. Siliconix is a major Silicon Valley semiconductor house and one of the valley's first and most prestigious. It was co-founded by Frances Hugle who served as its Director of R&amp;D and Chief Engineer and developed its first products(and critical fab equipment).

:Also, Fran was working on classified contracts at Baldwin in the fifties and most of her work could not be discussed, even after she left.

:But, possibly my edit should be rewritten. 
 
:I am only trying to insert into the invention chronology the actual patents that first described how to fabricate an IC. In fact, later patents such as Noyce's do not detail this process.

:Not including the all important reduction to practice breakthrough seems VERY biased especially when the article devotes time to highlighting those who contributed only theoretical speculations on its feasibility.

:Also, though I shared this info on the Talk page initially in hopes that someone else would incorporate it, not only did no one take the initiative, it was suggested that I do it myself. I decided to do so only after giving sufficient time for others to do the insert.

:"and a number of similar edits since early December."

:I do not know what this is regarding. I have made no others but maybe this refers to other editors.

:"To further clarify, in the "Integrated circuit" article is only about monolithic integrated circuits, and does not cover [[Hybrid integrated circuit]]s."

:The Frances Hugle patent(s) does not describe a 'hybrid integrated circuit'. It describes a 'monolithic integrated circuit' and was filed in 1956.

::It is highly questionable whether the patents describe monolithic integrated circuits. Monolithic integrated circuits, especially early ones, usually consist of a single crystal substrate on which are created, through diffusion or growth, single crystal devices (that is, all the transistors on the whole substrate are part of a single crystal, although the gate of MOS transistors may be polycrystaline). Creating decent quality transistors, whether bipolar or FET, requires that they be made of a single crystal. The Hugle patents did not provide a way to fabricate single crystal devices. But that just goes to show that it requires original research to determine whether the patents provide a process used fabricate a monolithic integrated circuit.

* I don't see this as an issue of reliability, so much as a technical one of definitions. There are credible patents here about a credible invention – however ''are they [[integrated circuit]]s?'', according to our operating definition of what an integrated circuit is, and has to be to be counted as such?

Eg "In Patent 000, Dr. Smith claims to have invented perpetual motion."

* This question is in the wrong forum; it is a [[WP:OR]] issue in [[WP:RS]] clothing. Patents can be reliable sources for statements that do not require interpretation. If the inventor describes something clearly, then that description can be made in the article, but it may not be embellished. Hugle invented a photosensor array; that's in the patent.  Hugle patented some isolation techniques; the patent file and issue dates may be reported. If some prior patent (or other prior published work) clearly described a process that fabricated different isolated components (e.g., R, C, Q) on a single wafer and wired them together into complete circuits, then no interpretation would be required and editors could easily reach a consensus that the thing described in the patent was an IC.  (For example, Monopoly was published prior to Parker Bros' copyright.) That's not the case here.  Editors may not read some patents and draw conclusions about what the patents mean or imply because that would be [[WP:OR]] or [[WP:SYNTHESIS]]. I read the Hugle patents when this issue came up at [[Frances Hugle]], and I get a much different impression of her claims and priority.  In any event, editors may not read a patent and conclude that an array of photocells is an integrated circuit or that depositing polysilicon on a substrate is inventing the microprocessor.  Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't, but we don't get to make that call.  WP needs secondary sources to make those judgments. [[User:Glrx|Glrx]] ([[User talk:Glrx|talk]]) 06:29, 28 January 2013 (UTC)

:: What you have just described is traditionally called a Hybrid Integrated Circuit which is clearly NOT what Fran invented.

:: The real problem here is not OR or anything to do with Wiki rules. It is that those commenting or objecting to my contributions (and probably the contributions of others) do not have a clue what is being claimed (by me, or the inventor) or what the actual definitions are of the things they are discussing (i.e. an IC)... and so we go round and round. It is time wasting for everyone. Please become better informed on the subjects to which you wish to contribute, it is not enough to copy technical terms and then throw them haphazardly about thinking that will win the day.

I compiled some excerpts from Frances' patent(s) that clearly indicate Frances described how to fabricate an IC long before Kilby or Noyce made any claims in that regard. It lost its formatting and for that I apologize. Before getting into her words though I would like to offer a review of what an IC is. I keep encountering Wiki editors who are quick to tell me Frances did not invent it but aren't clear at all about what it is.

(It seems that the person who brought this to this board is also somewhat confused, so hopefully these definitions will help simplify and clarify the matter.)

That said, I think a very non-controversial interim way to deal with this has been suggested by Masem. Possibly if those interested would read the excerpts I have compiled, we could achieve consensus?

Before we consider the claims Frances received patents for, we need to know what an integrated circuit is...

1) An integrated circuit (IC), also called microelectronic circuit or chip,  is an assembly of electronic components, fabricated as a single unit, in which miniaturized active devices (e.g., transistors and diodes) and passive devices (e.g., capacitors and resistors) and their interconnections are built up on a thin substrate of semiconductor material (typically silicon). http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289645/integrated-circuit-IC

2) Integrated circuits, also called "chips", are electronic circuits where all the components (transistors, diodes, resistors and capacitors) has been manufactured in the surface of a thin substrate of semiconductor material. http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/physics/integrated_circuit/

And here are some excerpts from Frances' patent(s) proving Frances invented the processes and the equipment to make them (reduction to practice).

From the first set of claims patented: http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&amp;NR=2994621A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=1&amp;date=19610801&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP
 
"The invention relates to the method of preparing semi conductive films and to the products of such methods." (Page 2, column 1, 1st paragraph)

"It is an object of the invention to provide a method for the direct production of semi-conductive films of metals or semi-metals which will be cheaper and more convenient than methods hitherto current in the art." (Page 2, Column 1, lines 27-30)

Page 2, Column 1, lines 35-49:

"It is an object of the invention to provide a method of forming semi-conductive films of metals or semi-metals in combination, in which stoichiometric proportions may be automatically obtained." (lines 35-38)

"It is an object of the invention to provide semi-conductive films of metallic or semi-metallic materials or combinations which may be selectively of the n or p types." (lines 39-41)

"It is an object of the invention to provide an improved method for making semi-conductive films having alternate areas of n and p characteristics." (lines 42-44)

"It is an object of the invention to provide a mode of manufacturing semi-conductive films of metallic or semi-metallic combinations, wherein the extent, area, disposition and thickness of the films can be easily, cheaply and accurately controlled." (lines 45-49)

"Briefly, in the practice of the invention, a series of films of metals or semi-metals is formed with the films in superposed relationship on a suitable substrate or support." (Page 2, Column 1, lines 67-70)

Page 3, Column 1, lines 42-65:

"In the fashion indicated, either n or p type films may be formed by varying the thicknesses of the layers and/or the temperature and time of the heating procedure. More than two layers maybe deposited of either of the metals or semi-metals." (lines 42-46)

"The support on which the films are formed should, of course, be of a material capable of withstanding the necessary heat treatment. Thus, it will be found that the glasses and ceramics are most available as substrates for use in the process. The films may be combined with printed circuitry if desired. While printed circuit elements may be formed on the composite in various ways, it is also possible to form the printed circuit first and impose the composite thereon. The material of the printed circuit if first imposed on the substrate should be such as will not fuse or amalgamate with the substances of the films at the temperature of the treatment. Otherwise there is substantially no limitation on the substance of the printed circuit excepting that it have the requisite conductivity. Metals and alloys are available. Excellent results have been obtained, for example, with Iconel metal. The printed circuit may be imposed on the substrate in any suitable fashion, as by printing or stenciling, or by etching an over-all coating." (lines 47-65)

Page 5, Column 1, Lines 8-23:

3. The process claimed in claim 1, wherein the substrate carries on its surface the elements of a printed circuit, and wherein said semi-conductive film is produced in a position to contact spaced elements of said printed circuit at least in part.
4. The process claimed in claim 1, wherein the substrate carries on its surface the elements of a printed circuit, and wherein said semi-conductive film is produced in a position overlying spaced elements of said printed circuit at least in part, and in electrical contact therewith, and wherein certain areas of the substrate surface are masked with a masking substance prior to the formation of the superposed films so as to restrict such formation to another area of the substrate surface, the masking material being removed prior to the reaction of the superposed films under heat.

::I think the wall of text above is missing the point.  Patents can only be used as a source to prove a) the existence of the patent and b) the exact text of the patent itself.  Per [[WP:OR]], you can't use the text of a document like a patent to support any statement at Wikipedia which requires you to provide your own analysis of what the patent ''means'', which severely limits their usefulness as sources to ''prove'' anything.  A patent filed under the name of "John Smith" would only prove that John Smith filed that patent.  It wouldn't prove that John Smith invented anything.  In order to establish that in a Wikipedia article, you would need another source which states that John Smith invented the thing you want to say he invented.  That is, unless there is a secondary source, a reliable one, published by a reliable writer in a reliable publication, which states in plain language "John Smith invented..." whatever, Wikipedia can't make that claim either.  At best, Wikipedia could make the claim "John Smith holds a patent on..." whatever, but that isn't the same thing as saying he invented it.  To say that the patent ''proves'' he invented it would require the Wikipedia writer to provide their own interpretation of the ''meaning'' of the patent itself, which [[WP:OR|we're not supposed to do]].  --[[User:Jayron32|&lt;font style="color:#000099"&gt;Jayron&lt;/font&gt;]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|&lt;font style="color:#009900"&gt;32&lt;/font&gt;]]''''' 07:00, 28 January 2013 (UTC)

*This is a pretty straightforward example of a [[WP:PRIMARY|primary source]]. To quote the policy, "Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation." Any contested statements about being first in the field should be supported by a secondary source, not the text of a patent. The patent is a reliable source only for what the patent says.

::I agree that this is a suitable subject for this noticeboard. Patents present particular problems. In theory the mere existence of a patent means that it has been carefully examined and found to be truly innovative. However during periods of relatively strict interpretation this system was imperfect and in the US now it has basically been thrown away in practice. In short I agree this is a primary type of document, and the inspection process does not qualify as enough fact checking to mean WP can quote patents concerning strong claims without attribution. That does not of course mean that patents can't be used as a source in certain contexts, and using the right type of wording. Attribution will often allow us to avoid some of these concerns.--[[User:Andrew Lancaster|Andrew Lancaster]] ([[User talk:Andrew Lancaster|talk]]) 14:09, 28 January 2013 (UTC)

History Lesson in a Patent

If one reads the excerpts provided above, we can deduce a few things about the level of semiconductor device production sophistication in the mid fifties.

1) Semiconductor devices were being made in military funded labs at the time this application was written:

"It is an object of the invention to provide a method for the direct production of semi-conductive films of metals or semi-metals which will be cheaper and more convenient than methods hitherto current in the art." (Page 2, Column 1, lines 27-30)

This invention claims a major improvement ((cost and ease of production) in that devices would now be grown directly onto the substrate rather than added one by one later (thus making possible 'monolithic' IC production rather than the already current 'hybrid' IC production).

2) Circuitry was already being printed upon ceramic substrates (this is NOT the same as a printed circuit board)(see quote below):

"The support on which the films are formed should, of course, be of a material capable of withstanding the necessary heat treatment. Thus, it will be found that the glasses and ceramics are most available as substrates for use in the process. The films may be combined with printed circuitry if desired. While printed circuit elements may be formed on the composite in various ways, it is also possible to form the printed circuit first and impose the composite thereon. The material of the printed circuit if first imposed on the substrate should be such as will not fuse or amalgamate with the substances of the films at the temperature of the treatment. Otherwise there is substantially no limitation on the substance of the printed circuit excepting that it have the requisite conductivity. Metals and alloys are available. Excellent results have been obtained, for example, with Iconel metal. The printed circuit may be imposed on the substrate in any suitable fashion, as by printing or stenciling, or by etching an over-all coating." (lines 47-65)

3) The improvement here is that devices are grown directly onto the substrate rather than added to it (see quote below):

Page 5, Column 1, Lines 8-23:

"3. The process claimed in claim 1, wherein the substrate carries on its surface the elements of a printed circuit, and wherein said semi-conductive film is produced in a position to contact spaced elements of said printed circuit at least in part.
4. The process claimed in claim 1, wherein the substrate carries on its surface the elements of a printed circuit, and wherein said semi-conductive film is produced in a position overlying spaced elements of said printed circuit at least in part, and in electrical contact therewith, ..."

These facts of patent tell us that Kilby did not invent the Hybrid IC, it was already in a much more advanced state at the time Frances submitted her patent application describing how to grow devices directly onto a substrate (the monolithic IC, now simply called an IC). 

The Kilby story was probably invented to enable commercialization of this technology without disclosing its level of sophistication, which was classified.

Similarly, a very opaque patent was cobbled for Noyce. 

If we forget the crucible (classified military) in which such inventions become possible, we are left with nothing but mythology... and that is surely reflected in Wikipedia's present treatment of the invention of the IC, something I sincerely hope will be possible to correct.

Historical Reflections

The Frances Hugle patent(s) were awarded in 1961 and 1965. I imagine that one of the reasons they were delayed was due to decisions to introduce the technologies, declassify them, in a certain way that precluded exposing the classified work at Baldwin.

Additionally, following the death of Frances, a popular journalist, Don Hoefler, entered Silicon Valley and proceeded to codify the history of the industry. Still, according one of Don's close relatives, he admitted privately that he knew Frances had invented the IC and not Noyce.

Regardless, you now have proof of who invented the monolithic IC and the processes involved.

===The short answer===
Patents are not a reliable source for invention priority, as can be seen by all the argumentation above. They require interpretation by secondary sources to say, "this patent was issued before any others, and that's good enough evidence of priority." In cases where someone developed a similar technology earlier, we need secondary sources which consider the earlier invention to have priority. We don't have to discuss this particular case, but the sheer length of the discussion is evidence for the need for interpretation, showing that patents are a primary source. [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 18:30, 28 January 2013 (UTC)

:"Patents are not a reliable source for invention priority, as can be seen by all the argumentation above."

: I had never before heard that a claim becomes invalid simply because many people express opposing points of views, whether or not those points of view have any validity. And, patents are most DEFINITELY a reliable source of invention priority IF they are published PRIOR to those claiming the invention. Seriously, what absurd nonsense! I can't believe anyone would assert it..

:"They require interpretation by secondary sources to say, "this patent was issued before any others, and that's good enough evidence of priority.""

: NO, they do not! The date of issue and the date of application are included on the patent. This is most definitely a case where primary sources are acceptable.

:"In cases where someone developed a similar technology earlier, we need secondary sources which consider the earlier invention to have priority."

:You need a secondary source to state that an earlier invention has priority? Because later inventions are generally assumed to have priority? Excuse me but this is exactly why people like me get frustrated with Wiki editors... just throw the spaghetti at the wall... if it doesn't stick, take a vote... never mind if it is edible (logical). 

:"We don't have to discuss this particular case, but the sheer length of the discussion is evidence for the need for interpretation, showing that patents are a primary source."

: Again, I did not open the discussion nor assume any of it necessary. So, that is not a reason to insist I am wrong... that a bunch of people want to deny a reasonable edit and will claim anything at all to support their preferences... including the fact that they are involved in denying it and therefore it should be denied.

: Additionally, no one here is stating the patents are not primary sources. But, primary sources are ACCEPTABLE sources if they strictly support the text for which they are being used as a reference. And, that is what this issue is about; Inserting a reference to the patent(s) that was filed years prior to filings by Noyce or Kilby (stated at the top of each patent) in which the process to fabricate monolithic ICs is revealed. Not including these patents is simple censorship.

::Ms. Hugle, you are missing the point. That you have to argue for your interpretation of what the various patents say is ''prima facie'' evidence that this is ''your interpretation''. A patent '''never''' supports the claim that "X invented this first" in the sense that counts in Wikipedia, that is, a patent never states some version of "X invented this first." Patents provide evidence to a historian who compares the various documents and provides the evaluation that "X invented this first," and it is ''that'' evaluation which can be used as to support a similar statement in our articles. Your personal evaluation is not acceptable. You can find someone reputable who is pushing the same theory of priority you are, and you can argue for us to prefer them over other sources, but that's it. Your position ''needs'' to be "censored" if you can't find some more authoritative support, and if you don't see this, then you need to find something else to do. [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 21:13, 28 January 2013 (UTC)



::: "That you have to argue for your interpretation of what the various patents say is prima facie evidence that this is your interpretation."

:::: No, that is not the case. The fact that I say something is as it states it is (e.g. declarations in a patent) and you say it is not... does not prove that 'You have to argue for your interpretation.' If I say the stars are shining and they are, and you say stars may not exist and therefore it is an interpretive matter whether they exist... then my repeated statements that they do does not prove that it is 'my interpretation'.

:::: "A patent '''never''' supports the claim that "X invented this first" in the sense that counts in Wikipedia, that is, a patent never states some version of "X invented this first.""

:::: Then all those people fighting about patent infringement must simply be mistaken. Patents are dated for a reason and sorry, but the above statement is sheer nonsense. A date on a patent does in fact very definitely tell us who did what when and allows us to place various events (patented) in chronological order. I can't actually believe that these arguments are necessary. Am I really supposed to take this seriously? Are you really serious?

:::: "Your position ''needs'' to be "censored" if you can't find some more authoritative support, and if you don't see this, then you need to find something else to do."

:::: My position needs to be censored? I have provided an authoritative reference for the edit I made. That is what is under dispute. If you make up nonsense, and then trheaten me becasue I refuse to accept it, then you are in the wrong. I every right to defend my edit here and so far, no one has been able to claim anything viable that would disallow it... with one exception. And that is that I made it and thus there are according to Wiki rules COI issues.

:::: Still, the edit was NOT biased, was based on sources, was not interpretive and should have been included by other editors without COI issues... which is the reason I am still involved here. But, I certainly do not have to play dumb just to get along... 

:::: "Patents provide evidence to a historian who compares the various documents and provides the evaluation that "X invented this first," and it is ''that'' evaluation which can be used as to support a similar statement in our articles. Your personal evaluation is not acceptable. You can find someone reputable who is pushing the same theory of priority you are, and you can argue for us to prefer them over other sources, but that's it."

:::: I am not 'pushing a theory'. Again, that is YOUR INTERPRETATION. I am attempting to insert the name and date of the patent(s) (into an historical section on Integrated Circuits where it clearly belongs) in which the process to produce monolithic ICs is explained and claimed and those claims have been validated. The date of the patent is a matter of record, no interpretation needed so, 'the theory of priority' is certainly a strange way to describe a US patent office filing stamp!

:::: Example. I diagram, for the first time, a tricycle. The media claims it was invented in June. My diagram was stamped by the US patent office in March, two months prior. A third person claims that my patented diagram of March was a prior invention. They decide to include that in a Wikipedia article about tricycles. Their edit is denied on the basis that they are interpreting... even though all they do is state that the diagram for the tricycle was done in March, provide the name of the person who drew it and include links to the patented drawing.

:::: This is very tiring and I am not of a mind to keep trying to refute baseless assertions. In any case, my edit has already been removed... and that is certainly not an improvement in the IC article nor does it help those seeking info on the history of the IC. Good work, Wiki editors! Attack those offering real enrichment to this project.

Cheryl, you really need to get the point of the replies here.  Please stop criticising participants for not understanding what an IC is.  I have made ICs and am perfectly capable of understanding and drawing conclusions from Hugle's patents.  But I am ''not'' permitted to write those conclusions into a Wikipedia article.  This is not the place to establish Hugle's claims.  You need to establish those claims elsewhere.  When the results are published in an independent source ''then'' you can add something to Wikipedia.

:"Please stop criticising participants for not understanding what an IC is."

:: I am certainly within my rights when people make fallacious statements about technologies they simply do not understand and pretend to an understanding they do not have in an obvious attempt to denigrate other editors contributions. 

:"I have made ICs and am perfectly capable of understanding and drawing conclusions from Hugle's patents."

:: While this may be true, I asked no one to draw conclusions. I made statements that were clearly supported by the primary source and did not require interpretation. On the other hand, it is necessary that someone know the definitions of terms, and that seems to be more the issue.

:"This is not the place to establish Hugle's claims."

:: Sorry, the existence of the patent is Frances' claim. It is already established. That Wikipedia refuses to acknowledge it exists is absurd.

:"You need to establish those claims elsewhere."

:: No I do not. They have already been established by the US patent office and I am attempting to make no interpretive statement not already established by the US patent office and included in the patent... 

::In such a case as this, use of a primary source is allowed according to Wiki rules.

:"When the results are published in an independent source ''then'' you can add something to Wikipedia."

:: The results of her claims were awarded Letters of Patent by the US patent office. That is an independent source!

::The USPTO is a primary source publisher for patents, people have had patents invalidated, so publishing a patent is not proof of priority, only that the USPTO didn't find anything at the time of publications. But since patents are invalidated frequently, clearly the USPTO is not perfect on things.

::: "...people have had patents invalidated, so publishing a patent is not proof of priority, only that the USPTO didn't find anything at the time of publications."

::: Rather a meaningless observation. This discussion is NOT about whether Frances' patent(s) is the absolute earliest (It is though most definitely the earliest one to come to light thus far). It is actually ONLY asserting that it is EARLIER than the ones submitted by Noyce and Kilby. And that is a matter of patent record... the filing dates given by the patent office assures us that her patent(s) were submitted years earlier. In other words, yes, the date of her patent DOES PROVE PRIORITY over the patents submitted by Noyce and Kilby. There is absolutely NO WAY to assert otherwise.

::::Really?  And that assertion, that "the date of her patent DOES PROVE PRIORITY", where did you read that?  Because unless you have a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] that draws that conclusion already, you cannot draw that conclusion yourself.  That's the whole point people are trying to explain to you.  You cannot draw your own conclusions from primary sources.  All conclusions can only be restatements of conclusions that have been established in existing literature.

But, I was encouraged there to introduce it myself, and after waiting a substantial amount of time and noting no one else undertook the task, I introduced the text (in quotes below) being careful not to alter pre-existing contributions.

::::::: I am not wed to the exact words by any means. My only point was to make a note in the  IC history section that a patent was filed on the process to make monolithic ICs in 1956 and it was awarded Letters of Patent on two separate dates because its claims were split, one set awarded in 1961 and one set in 1965.

::::::: Text I wrote that has been deleted and that I would like at least partially reinstated:

::::::: "Also in 1956, a patent application describing how to fabricate an IC was filed by Frances Hugle, US 3226271, Hugle, Frances B. &amp; William B. Hugle, "Semi-Conductive Films and Method of Producing Them", published March 29, 1956. This patent was ultimately divided into two claim sets, the first set was awarded articles of patent in 1961 (patent no. US 2994621) and the second set in 1965 (patent no. US 3226271).

::::::: This is the first published description of how to actually grow semiconductor devices on a substrate incorporating a printed circuit, what equipment is required for this purpose and how to regulate the process depending upon what characteristics are desired.

::::::: Though Frances was the first to describe how to fabricate an IC, her claims were not patented until after both Noyce and Kilby were awarded patents for her invention. (please see the Inventors section of this article's Talk page for a more in depth discussion of the Frances Hugle patent(s).)

::::::: Thus ideas such as those following continue being espoused:"

::::::: Minimally, I think the first paragraph quoted above should be included where it was originally placed in [[Integrated_circuit#Invention|the history section of the article]](just after the second paragraph).

::::::::Actually, I think everything from "This is the first published description..." forward are interpretive, and would require secondary source confirmation to state that they were the first.  The dates of the patents, and their content, can be garnered from the patents themselves.  However, the patent itself contains no information about what may or may not have come before these.  It may be the first such IC of its kind, or it may not be, but that can't be shown via the text of the patent itself, ''per se''.  What you would need is a reliable secondary source which analyzes all of the available information and itself makes the claim that this was the first.
