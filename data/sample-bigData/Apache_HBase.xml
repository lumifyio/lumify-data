'''HBase''' is an [[open source]], [[Non-relational database|non-relational]], [[distributed database]] modeled after [[Google|Google's]] [[BigTable]] and is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It is developed as part of [[Apache Software Foundation]]'s [[Hadoop|Apache Hadoop]] project and runs on top of [[Hadoop Distributed Filesystem|HDFS (Hadoop Distributed Filesystem)]], providing BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop. That is, it provides a [[fault-tolerant]] way of storing large quantities of sparse{{Clarify|date=October 2012}} data. 

HBase features compression, in-memory operation, and [[Bloom filter]]s on a per-column basis as outlined in the original BigTable paper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://db.usenix.org//events/osdi06/tech/chang/chang_html/ Chang, et al. (2006). Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data]&lt;/ref&gt; Tables in HBase can serve as the input and output for [[Mapreduce|MapReduce]] jobs run in Hadoop, and may be accessed through the [http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/index.html Java API] but also through [[REST]], [[Avro_(serialization_system)|Avro]] or [[Thrift (protocol)|Thrift]] gateway APIs.

HBase is not a direct replacement for a classic [[SQL]] [[database]], although recently its performance has improved, and it is now serving several data-driven websites,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/PoweredBy Powered By HBase]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/9912857/HBase-nosql-presentation StumbleUpon HBase Presentation]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Facebook]]'s Messaging Platform.&lt;ref name="the-underlying-technology-of-messages"&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/the-underlying-technology-of-messages/454991608919 The Underlying Technology of Messages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theregister"&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/17/facebook_messages_tech/ Facebook: Why our 'next-gen' comms ditched MySQL] Retrieved: 17th December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the parlance of Eric Brewerâ€™s [[CAP theorem]], HBase is a CP type system.

==History==
Apache HBase began as a project by the company [[Powerset (company)|Powerset]] out of a need to process massive amounts of data for the purposes of [[natural language search]]. It is now a top-level Apache project and has generated considerable interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/powerset/default.aspx Powerset Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook elected to implement its new messaging platform using HBase in November 2010.&lt;ref name="the-underlying-technology-of-messages"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
