'''Tobias Preis''' is a German complex systems scientist. He is Associate Professor of [[Behavioral Science]] and [[Finance]] at [[Warwick Business School]] which is a department of the [[University of Warwick]]. He is a computational social scientist focussing on analysis and prediction of social and financial complexity captured in [[big data]]. Preis is also a Visiting Lecturer at [[University College London]]. In 2011, he worked as a Senior Research Fellow with [[H. Eugene Stanley]] at [[Boston University]] and with [[Dirk Helbing]] at [[ETH Zurich]]. In 2009, he was named a member of the Gutenberg Academy. In 2007, he founded Artemis Capital Asset Management GmbH, a [[proprietary trading]] firm which is based in Germany. He was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in physics from the [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz]] in Germany.

Preis has quantified and modelled financial market fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zeit.de/2011/33/CH-Oekonophysik/seite-1 | title = Es braucht ein neues Finanzsystem | author = Peer Teuwsen | work = [[Die Zeit]] | date = August 15, 2011 | accessdate = May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/hintergrund/wissenschaft/wie_finanzblasen_platzen_1.10616793.html | title = Wie Finanzblasen platzen | author = Leonid Leiva | work = [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] | date = May 18, 2011 | accessdate = May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he has made contributions to general-purpose computing on graphics processing units ([[GPGPU]]) in [[statistical physics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Block | first = Benjamin | last2 = Virnau | first2 = Peter | last3 = Preis | first3 = Tobias | title = Multi-GPU accelerated multi-spin Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D Ising model | journal = [[Computer Physics Communications]] | volume = 181 | pages = 1549–1556 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpc.2010.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Preis | first = Tobias | last2 = Virnau | first2 = Peter | last3 = Paul | first3 = Wolfgang | last4 = Schneider | first4 = Johannes J. | title = GPU accelerated Monte Carlo simulation of the 2D and 3D Ising model | journal = [[Journal of Computational Physics]] | volume = 228 | pages = 4468–4477 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcp.2009.03.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[computational finance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Preis | first = Tobias | last2 = Virnau | first2 = Peter | last3 = Paul | first3 = Wolfgang | last4 = Schneider | first4 = Johannes J. | title = Accelerated fluctuation analysis by graphic cards and complex pattern formation in financial markets | journal = [[New Journal of Physics]] | volume = 11 | pages = 093024 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1088/1367-2630/11/9/093024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Preis headed a research team which provided evidence that search engine query data and stock market fluctuations are correlated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Preis | first = Tobias | last2 = Reith | first2 = Daniel | last3 = Stanley | first3 = H.

In 2012, Preis used [[Google Trends]] data to demonstrate together with his colleagues [[Helen Susannah Moat]], [[H. Eugene Stanley]] and [[Steven R. Bishop]] that Internet users from countries with a higher per capita gross domestic product ([[GDP]]) are more likely to search for information about the future than information about the past. The findings, published in the journal [[Scientific Reports]], suggest there may be a link between online behaviour and real-world economic indicators.&lt;ref name="srep"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Tobias Preis, Helen Susannah Moat, H. Eugene Stanley and Steven R. Bishop | title=Quantifying the Advantage of Looking Forward | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume= 2 | pages=350 | year=2012 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | doi=10.1038/srep00350 | pmid=22482034 | pmc=3320057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21678-online-searches-for-future-linked-to-economic-success.html | title=Online searches for future linked to economic success | author=Paul Marks | work=[[New Scientist]] | date=April 5, 2012 | accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2012/04/google-trends-reveals-clues-about-the-mentality-of-richer-nations.ars | title=Google Trends reveals clues about the mentality of richer nations | author=Casey Johnston | work=[[Ars Technica]] | date=April 6, 2012 | accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/6/2929917/nature-future-orientation-index-gdp-versus-google-trends | title=Wealthier countries are more interested in the future | author=Andrew Webster | work=[[The Verge (website)|The Verge]] | date=April 6, 2012 | accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preis and colleagues examined Google search queries made by Internet users in 45 different countries in 2010 and calculated the ratio of the volume of searches for the coming year (‘2011’) to the volume of searches for the previous year (‘2009’), which they call the [[Future Orientation Index]]. A comparison of the [[Future Orientation Index]] to the per capita GDP of each country revealed a strong tendency for countries in which Google users enquire more about the future to exhibit a higher GDP. Preis and colleagues conclude from this study that a relationship potentially exists between the economic success of a country and the information-seeking behaviour of its citizens online.&lt;ref name="srep" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/feb/08/countries-most-forward-thinking-visualised | title=Which countries are the most forward thinking?
