'''Chef''' is a [[configuration management]] tool written in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]]. It uses a pure-Ruby, [[domain-specific language]] (DSL) for writing system configuration "recipes" or "cookbooks".  Chef was written by [[Opscode]] and is released as [[open source]] under the [[Apache License]] 2.0. Chef is a [[DevOps]] tool used for configuring [[Cloud computing|cloud services]] or to streamline the task of configuring a company's internal servers.  Chef automatically sets up and tweaks the [[operating systems]] and programs that run in massive [[data centers]].&lt;ref name = "wired"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/10/chef_and_puppet/ | title = Chef &amp; Puppet | journal = Wired | year = 2011 | month = Oct}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chef can run using a [[client/server]] model, or on a consolidated configuration named "chef-solo".  Chef can be integrated with Cloud-based platforms such as [[Rackspace]] and [[Amazon EC2]]. Traditionally, Chef is used to manage [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] but later versions support running on [[Windows]] as well.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

The user writes "recipes" that describe how Chef manages server applications (such as [[Apache]], [[MySQL]], or [[Hadoop]]) and how they are to be configured.  These recipes describe a series of resources that should be in a particular state – packages that should be installed, services that should be running, or files that should be written.  Chef makes sure each resource is properly configured, and automatically discovers data points of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.opscode.com/chef/ | title = Ops code | contribution = Chef}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When used in a [[client/server]] model, the Chef client sends various attributes about the node to the Chef server. The server uses [[Solr]] to index these attributes and provides an API for clients to query this information. Chef recipes can query these attributes and use the resulting data to help configure the node.  

Chef can be used to create clones of [[Quality Assurance]] environments, pre-production environments, and partner preview environments. Once automated, a blueprint is created for the infrastructure, enabling the user to build, or rebuild, automatically in minutes or hours.

It is one of the four major configuration management systems on [[Linux]], along with [[CFEngine]], [[Bcfg2]], and [[Puppet (software)|Puppet]].&lt;ref name = "Chef vs Puppet"&gt;{{Citation | title = Script rock | contribution = Puppet vs Chef battle wages | url = https://www.scriptrock.com/articles/puppet-vs-chef-battle-wages/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first =C | last = Lueninghoener| publisher = Usenix | format = [[PDF]] | title= Getting Started with Configuration Management | journal = [[;login:]] | month = April | year = 2011 | volume = 36 | number = 2 | url = https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/105457-Lueninghoener.pdf|accessdate = 2012‐11‐23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Opscode released version 11 of Chef. Changes in this release included a complete rewrite of the core [[Application programming interface|API]] server, in [[Erlang (programming language)| Erlang]].&lt;ref name = chef11&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.opscode.com/blog/2013/02/04/chef-11-released/| title= Chef 11 Released! | publisher =[[Opscode]]|date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
