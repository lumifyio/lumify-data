===[[Eucalculus]]===
Article starts "Eucalculus is a term devised by Charles Douglas Wehner for an extended form of the infinitesimal calculus." and is signed with CDW. Neither MathSciNet nor Zentralblatt MATH (big databases with information on maths articles) has an article mentioning eucalculus. All webpages containing "eucalculus" known to Google are connected to Mr Wehner. Nonnotable and original research, so '''delete'''. [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] 22:54, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''.  The author seems to think this is an idea newly introduced in the 1970s.  The idea of derivatives of non-integer orders is much older than that.  See [[fractional calculus]].  It is probably not known by the name ''eucalculus'' other than by the person who wrote this article. [[User:Michael Hardy|Michael Hardy]] 02:03, 13 May 2005 (UTC)
