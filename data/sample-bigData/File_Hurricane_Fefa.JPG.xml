{{Information
|Description= This oblique view of Hurricane Fefa shows the full extent of this storm with a cloud gyre several hundred miles in diameter and an elevated segment around the eye. The elevated segment bordering the eye indicates a tightly formed gyre with high internal wind speeds. At the time of this exposure, Fefa was located between the California coast and Hawaii. Fefa eventually dissipated at sea, failing to make landfall and thus did no property damage.
