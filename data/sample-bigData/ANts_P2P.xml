'''ANts P2P''' is an [[Anonymous P2P|anonymous peer-to-peer]] [[open source]] [[file sharing]] software written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. The software was initially conceived in 2003 to explore the potentials offered by a number of novel [[routing protocol]]s (ARA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Imed Bouazizi |title=ARA - The Ant-Colony Based Routing Algorithm for MANETs |doi=10.1109/ICPPW.2002.1039715 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ants-based routing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=M. Heissenbüttel, T. Braun |title=Ants-Based Routing in Large Scale Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks |url=http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~rvs/publications/HeissenBraunAntsBasedRouting.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mobile ad hoc network|MANET]] routing protocols&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mesut Günes, Otto Spaniol |title=Routing Algorithms for Mobile Multi-Hop Ad-Hoc |id = {{citeseerx|10.1.1.12.9449}} |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) based on [[Swarm_intelligence#Ant-based_routing|swarm intelligence]].

== History ==
A report (in Italian, wrote in 2004) about the initial phases of the project can be downloaded from the software website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Roberto Rossi |title=ANts P2P una rete multi-hop anonima e sicura|url=http://antsp2p.sourceforge.net/antsp2phelp/ANtsP2P.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short summary in English is available on the ANts P2P website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Roberto Rossi|title=ANts P2P project description|url=http://antsp2p.sourceforge.net/ANtsProject.html|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software developed was subsequently made available on [[Sourceforge]] in 2004. The code is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]. As of the 7th of November 2010, this software has been downloaded by over 500.000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sourceforge |title=ANtsP2P project download statistics |url=http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/detail.php?group_id=106782&amp;ugn=antsp2p&amp;type=prdownload&amp;mode=alltime&amp;file_id=0 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
ANts P2P encrypts all data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Slyck News |title=Slyck News - ANts P2P2P: A New Approach to File-Sharing |url=http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=567 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; sent or received from peer nodes ([[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] 128 bits - [[Diffie-Hellman|DH]] 512 bits). Furthermore, it dynamically establishes on demand "virtual encrypted tunnels" ([[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] 128 bits - [[Diffie-Hellman|DH]] 512 bits) among nodes that are willing to exchange a file.&lt;br&gt;
Encrypted packets are then exchanged via intermediate nodes in the network; these intermediate nodes have no systematic way available for intercepting keys and packets. Therefore it is difficult to perform [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s in this network. This second layer of encryption is called endpoint encryption. Theoretically, endpoint encryption means proxy nodes cannot identify the data they proxy. So this can make it harder to determine the originating [[IP address]]es of a given packet transmitted through the network.

Some of its features include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ANTs P2P Project at Sourceforge |title=ANTs P2P |url=http://antsp2p.sourceforge.net/ |accessdate=2010-10-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101112174754/http://antsp2p.sourceforge.net/| archivedate= 12 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ants P2P Guide |title=Ants P2P Guide |url=http://antsp2p.altervista.org/features.html |accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open Source [[Java (programming language)|Java]] implementation (GNU-GPL license).
* Portable "all-in-one-folder" release that does not require setup.
* [[Multipath routing]] for packets.
* Preferential connections to give the network a fast [[Backbone network|backbone]].
* Support for partial [[download]]s with automatic resume.
* Multiple sources download.
* Swarming (aka [[segmented downloading]]) from partial files.
* Autosearch sources for active and interrupted downloads.
* Distributed/Decentralized Search engine by [[MD5]] hash, string and structured query.
* Full text search of indexed documents (pdf, html, txt, doc etc.) powered by Apache [[Lucene]].
* Support for the [[eDonkey2k]] link format.
* [[IRC]] based peer discovery system.
* [[IRC]] embeded [[online chat|chat]] system.
* Completely [[Object-Oriented]] [[routing protocol]].
* Serverless [[GWebCache]]-based peer discovery procedure.
* [[HTTP]] server tunneling.
* ANts allow P2P communications through any kind of [[HTTP Proxy]].
* ANts allow P2P communications through any kind of [[NAT]] or [[traffic filtering system]].
* Point-to-point [[encryption]] ([[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] 128 - [[Diffie-Hellman|DH]] 512).
* End to end encryption ([[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] 128 - [[Diffie-Hellman|DH]] 512).
* Queries are encrypted [[Asymmetric key algorithm|asymmetrically]]. This means that only the originator can read the query results. Everyone can read the query string but this asymmetric approach reduces the potential of a node to do transit query analysis.

== Security ==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}
The data transfers run over indirect connections: Senders and receivers of a file do not hold a direct connection with each other, but the connection cascades over several nodes, so that neither party can trivially determine the other's identity.

The traffic between nodes is encrypted with [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]], which prevents sniffing both from outsiders and from transit nodes. The encryption key exchange uses [[Diffie-Hellman]] algorithm.

ANts P2P also allows users to offer [[web server]]s anonymously;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gwren |title=ANts P2P tutorial |url=http://antsp2p.sourceforge.net/antsp2phelp/HttpConnections.htm |accessdate=2010-11-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101018065029/http://antsp2p.sourceforge.net/antsp2phelp/HttpConnections.htm| archivedate= 18 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; these servers are only reachable from within the ANts P2P network. ANts P2P is however not an outproxy network which lets users reach services on the conventional internet; for this, an outproxy service such as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] can be used separately.
