'''Programming with Big Data in R''' (pbdR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ostrouchov, G., Chen, W.-C., Schmidt, D., Patel, P.|title=Programming with Big Data in R|year=2012|url=http://r-pbd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a series of [[R (programming language)|R]] packages and an environment for [[statistical computing]] with [[Big Data]] by utilizing high-performance statistical computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chen, W.-C. and Ostrouchov, G.|url=http://thirteen-01.stat.iastate.edu/snoweye/hpsc/|year=2011|title=HPSC -- High Performance Statistical Computing for Data Intensive Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pbdR uses the same programming language as R with [[S (programming language)|S3/S4]] classes and methods which is used among [[statistician]]s and [[Data mining|data miners]] for developing [[statistical software]]. The significant difference between pbdR and R codes is pbdR mainly focuses on [[distributed memory]] system where data are distributed across several processors and analyzed in a [[Batch processing|batch mode]], while communications between processors are based on [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] which is easily utilized in large [[High-performance computing|high-performance computing (HPC)]] systems. R system mainly focuses{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} on single [[Multi-core processor| multi-core]] machines for data analysis via an interactive mode such as [[Graphical user interface|GUI interface]].

Two main implementations in [[R (programming language)|R]] using [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] are Rmpi&lt;ref name=rmpi/&gt; and pbdMPI of pbdR.
* The pbdR built on pbdMPI uses [[SPMD|SPMD parallelism]] where every processors are considered as workers and own parts of data. The [[SPMD|SPMD parallelism]] introduced in mid 1980 is particularly efficient in homogeneous computing environments for large data, for example, performing [[Singular value decomposition|singular value decomposition]] on a large matrix, or performing [[Mixture model|clustering analysis]] on high-dimensional large data. On the other hand, there is no restriction to use [[Master/slave (technology)|manager/workers parallelism]] in [[SPMD|SPMD parallelism]] environment.
* The Rmpi&lt;ref name=rmpi/&gt; uses [[Master/slave (technology)|manager/workers parallelism]] where one main processor (manager) servers as the control of all other processors (workers). The [[Master/slave (technology)|manager/workers parallelism]] introduced around early 2000 is particularly efficient for large tasks in small [[Computer cluster|clusters]], for example, [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap method]] and [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]] in applied statistics since [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|i.i.d.]] assumption is commonly used in most [[Statistics|statistical analysis]]. In particular, task pull parallelism has better performance for Rmpi in heterogeneous computing environments.
The idea of [[SPMD|SPMD parallelism]] is to let every processors do the same works but on different parts of large data. For example, modern [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] is a large collection of slower co-processors which can simply apply the same computation on different parts of relatively smaller data, but the SPMD parallelism ends up an efficient way to obtain final solutions, i.e. time to solution is shorter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://graphics.stanford.edu/~mhouston/ | title = Folding@Home - GPGPU | author = Mike Houston | accessdate = 2007-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clearly that pbdR is not only suitable for small [[Computer cluster|clusters]], but also is stabler for analyzing [[Big data]] and is more scalable for [[Supercomputer|supercomputers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schmidt, D., Ostrouchov, G., Chen, W.-C., and Patel, P.|title=Tight Coupling of R and Distributed Linear Algebra for High-Level Programming with Big Data|year=2012|pages=811-815|journal=High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SCC), 2012 SC Companion:|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2477156}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, pbdR
* does '''not''' like Rmpi, snow, snowfall, do-like, '''nor''' parallel packages in R,
* does '''not''' focus on interactive computing '''nor''' master/workers,
* but is able to use '''both''' SPMD and task parallelisms.


== Package design ==
Programming with pbdR requires usage of various packages developed by pbdR core team. Packages developed are the following.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! General !! I/O !! Computation !! Application
|-
| [http://cran.r-project.org/package=pbdDEMO pbdDEMO] || [http://cran.r-project.org/package=pbdNCDF4 pbdNCDF4] || [http://cran.r-project.org/package=pbdDMAT pbdDMAT] || [http://cran.r-project.org/package=pmclust pmclust]

|}
[[File:Pbd overview.png|thumb|The images describes how various pbdr packages are correlated.]]
Among these packages, pbdMPI provides wrapper functions to [[MPI]] library, and it also produces a [[Library (computing)|shared library]] and a configuration file for [[MPI]] environments. All other packages rely on this configuration for installation and library loading that avoid difficulty of library linking and compiling. All other packages can directly utilize [[MPI]] functions easily.

* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pbdMPI/vignettes/pbdMPI-guide.pdf pbdMPI] --- an efficient interface to [[MPI]] either [[Open MPI|OpenMPI]] or [[MPICH2]] with a focus on Single Program/Multiple Data ([[SPMD]]) parallel programming style
* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pbdSLAP/vignettes/pbdSLAP-guide.pdf pbdSLAP] --- bundles scalable dense linear algebra libraries in double precision for R, based on [[ScaLAPACK]] version 2.0.2 which includes several scalable linear algebra packages (namely [[BLACS]], [[PBLAS]], and [[ScaLAPACK]]).
* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pbdNCDF4/vignettes/pbdNCDF4-guide.pdf pbdNCDF4] --- Interface to Parallel Unidata [[NetCDF|NetCDF4]] format data files
* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pbdBASE/vignettes/pbdBASE-guide.pdf pbdBASE] --- low-level [[ScaLAPACK]] codes and wrappers
* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pbdDMAT/vignettes/pbdDMAT-guide.pdf pbdDMAT] --- distributed matrix classes and computational methods, with a focus on linear algebra and statistics
* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pbdDEMO/vignettes/pbdDEMO-guide.pdf pbdDEMO] --- set of package demonstrations and examples, and this unifying vignette
* [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pmclust/vignettes/pmclust-guide.pdf pmclust] -- parallel [[Mixture model|model-based clustering]] using pbdR

Amount those packages the pbdDEMO package is a collection of 20+ package demos which offer example uses of the various pbdR packages, and contains a vignette which offers detailed explanations for the demos and provides some mathematical or statistical insight.

== Examples ==

=== Example 1===
Hello World! Save the following code in a file called ``demo.r``
&lt;source lang="rsplus"&gt;
### Initial MPI
library(pbdMPI, quiet = TRUE)
init()

comm.cat("Hello World!\n")

### Finish
finalize()
&lt;/source&gt;
and use the command
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
mpiexec -np 2 Rscript demo.r
&lt;/source&gt;
to execute the code where [[R|Rscript]] is one of command line executable program.

=== Example 2 ===
The following example modified from pbdMPI illustrates the basic [[programming language syntax|syntax of the language]] of pbdR.
Since pbdR is designed in [[SPMD]], all the R scripts are stored in files and executed from the command line via [[MPI|mpiexec]], [[MPI|mpirun]], etc. Save the following code in a file called ``demo.r``
&lt;source lang="rsplus"&gt;
### Initial MPI
library(pbdMPI, quiet = TRUE)
init()
.comm.size &lt;- comm.size()
.comm.rank &lt;- comm.rank()

### Set a vector x on all processors with different values
N &lt;- 5
x &lt;- (1:N) + N * .comm.rank

### All reduce x using summation operation
y &lt;- allreduce(as.integer(x), op = "sum")
comm.print(y)
y &lt;- allreduce(as.double(x), op = "sum")
comm.print(y)

### Finish
finalize()
&lt;/source&gt;
and use the command
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
mpiexec -np 4 Rscript demo.r
&lt;/source&gt;
to execute the code where [[R|Rscript]] is one of command line executable program.

=== Example 3 ===
The following example modified from pbdDEMO illustrates the basic ddmatrix computation of pbdR which performs [[Singular value decomposition|singular value decomposition]] on a given matrix.
Save the following code in a file called ``demo.r``
&lt;source lang="rsplus"&gt;
# Initialize process grid
library(pbdDMAT, quiet=T)
if(comm.size() != 2)
  comm.stop("Exactly 2 processors are required for this demo.")
init.grid()

# Setup for the remainder
comm.set.seed(diff=TRUE)
M &lt;- N &lt;- 16
BL &lt;- 2 # blocking --- passing single value BL assumes BLxBL blocking
dA &lt;- ddmatrix("rnorm", nrow=M, ncol=N, mean=100, sd=10)

# LA SVD
svd1 &lt;- La.svd(dA)
comm.print(svd1$d)

# Finish
finalize()
&lt;/source&gt;
and use the command
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
mpiexec -np 2 Rscript demo.r
&lt;/source&gt;
to execute the code where [[R|Rscript]] is one of command line executable program.
