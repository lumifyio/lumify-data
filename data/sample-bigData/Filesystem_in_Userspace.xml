'''Filesystem in Userspace''' ('''FUSE''') is a [[loadable kernel module]] for [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]]s that lets non-privileged users create their own [[file system]]s without editing [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] code. This is achieved by running file system code in [[user space]] while the FUSE module provides only a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces.

Released under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] and the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], FUSE is [[free software]]. The FUSE system was originally part of [http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf A Virtual Filesystem] (AVFS), but has since split off into its own project on [[SourceForge.net]].

FUSE is available for [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]] (as [[PUFFS (NetBSD)|puffs]]), [[OpenSolaris]], [[Minix 3]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[OS X]]&lt;ref&gt;http://osxfuse.github.io/&lt;/ref&gt;. It was officially merged into the mainstream [[Linux kernel]] tree in kernel version 2.6.14.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/47839 {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtual file system==
FUSE is particularly useful for writing [[virtual file system]]s. Unlike traditional file systems that essentially save data to and retrieve data from disk, virtual filesystems do not actually store data themselves. They act as a view or translation of an existing file system or storage device.

In principle, any resource available to a FUSE implementation can be exported as a file system.

== Ports ==
*[http://fuse4bsd.creo.hu/ Fuse for FreeBSD]
*[http://fuse4x.org/ Fuse4X] is a port of Fuse to [[OS X]] (now merged with OSXFuse.)
