      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Lattice Engines''' is a [[cloud-based]] [[Big Data]] company specializing in predictive analytics technology for sales and marketing departments in enterprise [[business-to-business]] (B2B) companies.  The company is privately held with headquarters in [[San Mateo, CA]] and offices in Austin, Boston, New York and Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lattice Engines Gets New Cash, Sees Big Data Gains Ahead |first= David|last=Zielenziger |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/lattice-engines-gets-new-cash-sees-big-data-gains-ahead-904146|newspaper= International Business Times|date=November 28, 2012 |accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company is backed by [[NEA]]{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2013}} and [[Sequoia Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Big Data News|first=Gil |last=Press |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2012/11/24/big-data-news-of-the-week-sexy-and-social-data-scientists/ |newspaper= Forbes|date= November 24, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and History==
The company was founded by Shashi Upadhyay, Kent McCormick and Andrew Schwartz in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Big Data helps sales people find the best potential prospects|first= Rachael|last= King|url= http://mobile.blogs.wsj.com/cio/2012/11/27/big-data-that-helps-sales-people-find-the-best-potential-customers/|newspaper= Wall Street Journal|date= November 27, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upadhyay currently serves as the company’s CEO, McCormick currently serves as the president and Schwartz currently serves as the chief architect.  

With a solid background in advanced analytics, and years of experience advising [[Fortune 500]] companies on Sales &amp; Marketing problems, Shashi was positioned to start Lattice.  After graduating from the Indian Institute of Technology, Shashi went on to get a Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University and then worked at [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], serving global companies on sales and marketing problems. He left as a partner to start Lattice because he saw a large unfulfilled need – CRM was designed to help sales managers, but no one was helping the front-line reps be more successful. He was convinced that a [[cloud-based]] solution that could use “all the data in the world” to generate insights for sales reps, would help them be more effective and make their job more fun. In 2006, when it was clear that the technology pieces were in place with both the cloud and Big Data taking off, he decided it was time to pursue this opportunity to impact the work-life of tens of thousands of frontline sellers and marketers.  

Kent McCormick (from [[EMC Corporation|EMC]]) and Andrew Schwartz (from Profitlogic, [[Algorithmics]]) joined Shashi as cofounders. The company was originally founded as a sales effectiveness consultancy and its product was first delivered in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= How Dell predicts which customers are most likely to buy|first= Rachael|last= King|url= http://www.lattice-engines.com/about-us/press-center/wall-street-journal-lattice-how-dell-predicts-customers-most-likely-to-buy|newspaper= Wall Street Journal|date= November 29, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
