'''General elections''' were held in [[San Marino]] on 4 March 1923 to elect the '''seventh term''' of the [[Grand and General Council]].&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1678 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[snap election]] which marked the beginning of the [[Fascist]] rule of the republic. [[Left-wing]] parties was prevented from participating, while all [[centre-right]] forces ran as a single "Patriotic Bloc".&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1686&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 60 seats, 29 were taken by the [[Sammarinese Fascist Party]], 20 by the [[Sammarinese People's Party]], 9 by the [[Sammarinese Democratic Union]] and two by the Fascist-puppets ''[[Sammarinese Fascist Party|Volunteers of War]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1690&lt;/ref&gt; Later the country was taken over by the Fascist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1670&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
San Marino had been close to a civil war in 1921, with Socialist red forces by a hand, and Christian Democratic white forces on the opposite side together with the Conservatives. The situation was so explosive that the government introduced a six-month censorship,&lt;ref&gt;Law 13 adopted on May 13, 1921. [http://www.consigliograndeegenerale.sm/on-line/home/archivio-leggi-decreti-e-regolamenti.html?P0_path=%2Fhome%2Ftomcat%2Findicizzazione%2Findexleggi&amp;P0_paginazione=15&amp;P0_pagina=3&amp;P0_orderBy=index_lucene%2Cdata_ordered%2Cnumero&amp;P0_order=asc%2Cdesc%2Cdesc&amp;P0_operatorMustBe=yes&amp;P0_title=&amp;P0_tipo=&amp;P0_numero=&amp;P0_anno=1921&amp;annoiniziale=&amp;annofinale=&amp;P0_data_gg=&amp;P0_data_mm=&amp;P0_data_aa=&amp;P0_document=&amp;P0_data_ordered=&amp;indicericerca=5.9884367&amp;x=36&amp;y=11&amp;=&amp; Grand and General Council database ] (it.)&lt;/ref&gt; and called a [[carabinieri]] garrison to restore order, while [[Fascist]] brigades entered in the country without invitation. Meanwhile, Sammarinese authorities became closer to [[Italy]], as underlined by the adoption of the anniversary of Italian victory in [[World War I]] as [[public holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;Law 33 adopted on November 16, 1922. [http://www.consigliograndeegenerale.sm/on-line/home/archivio-leggi-decreti-e-regolamenti.html?P0_path=%2Fhome%2Ftomcat%2Findicizzazione%2Findexleggi&amp;P0_paginazione=15&amp;P0_pagina=1&amp;P0_orderBy=index_lucene%2Cdata_ordered%2Cnumero&amp;P0_order=asc%2Cdesc%2Cdesc&amp;P0_operatorMustBe=yes&amp;P0_title=&amp;P0_tipo=&amp;P0_numero=&amp;P0_anno=1922&amp;annoiniziale=&amp;annofinale=&amp;P0_data_gg=&amp;P0_data_mm=&amp;P0_data_aa=&amp;P0_document=&amp;P0_data_ordered=&amp;indicericerca=6.2646894&amp;x=32&amp;y=6&amp;=&amp;=&amp; Grand and General Council database ] (it.)&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Benito Mussolini]] rose to power at [[Rome]], he immediately menaged to take control over the small republic. The old Council was forcely disbanded on January 27, 1923, and a [[snap election]] was consequently called. Fascist threats obtained their goal: the Socialist Party did not take part to the election and a sole, centre-right list called ''Patriotic Bloc'' ran undisputed. The Bloc was obviously dominated by the [[Sammarinese Fascist Party]], which obtained the majority of seats together with their puppets ''Volunteers of War''. The turnout was very low, leftist electors boycotting the vote.

Twenty-nine years old [[Giuliano Gozi]] became the first Fascist [[Captain Regent]] in April 1923. The party political program was to dismantle all democratic reforms of the [[Sammarinese Citizenry Meeting, 1906|Meeting of 1906]], and to emulate the Italian regime. A Sammarinese carabinieri corps was created, the anniversary of the [[March on Rome]] became a public holiday, and the Captains of the [[Municipalities of San Marino|Castles of San Marino]] became appointed by the Captains Regents.
