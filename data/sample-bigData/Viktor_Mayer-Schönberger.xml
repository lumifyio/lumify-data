== Biography ==
Mayer-Schönberger was born in 1966 in [[Zell am See]], where his mother owned a local cinema. After leaving secondary school in his hometown, he studied law for seven terms at the [[University of Salzburg]]. During this time, he competed successfully in the [[International Physics Olympiad]] and the Austrian Young Programmers Contest. 

In 1986, he founded Ikarus Software&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikarus.at/en/business/company-information/company-history/index.html Ikarus - Company History]&lt;/ref&gt; and developed ''Virus Utilities'', one of the best-selling software products in Austria. He subsequently earned law degrees at the [[University of Salzburg]] (Mag.iur, '88, Dr.iur '91) and at [[Harvard Law School]] (LL.M. '89). In 1992 he received a M.Sc. (Econ) from the [[London School of Economics]], and in 2001 the venia docendi on (among others) information law at the [[University of Graz]]. He also worked in his father's accounting business.

In 1998 he joined the faculty of [[Harvard Kennedy School]], where he worked and taught for ten years. After three years at [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]], [[National University of Singapore]], Mayer-Schönberger currently holds the Chair of Internet Governance and Regulation at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]]. As an expert on information law and regulation, he has been advising businesses, governments and international organisations.

== Work ==
Mayer-Schönberger's research focuses on the role of information in the networked economy. Among other things, he has been studying data privacy, governance in virtual worlds, law and entrepreneurship, e-government, and (most recently) big data.

He has been advocating a right to be forgotten in the form of expiration dates on personal information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-11-23/opinions/35509224_1_memories-digital-age-human Why we need to let our memories go], Washington Post, November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
