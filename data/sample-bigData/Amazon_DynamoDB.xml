'''Amazon DynamoDB''' is a fully managed [[NoSQL]] [[database]] service that is offered by [[Amazon.com]] as part of the [[Amazon Web Services]] portfolio.&lt;ref name='ZDNet 2012-01-19'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/cloud/2012/01/19/amazon-switches-on-dynamodb-cloud-database-service-40094849/ | title = Amazon switches on DynamoDB cloud database service | accessdate = 2012-01-21 | last = Clark | first = Jack | date = 2012-01-19 | work = ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; DynamoDB exposes a similar data model and derives its name from [[Dynamo_(storage_system)|Dynamo]], but has a different underlying implementation. Dynamo had a multi-master design requiring the client to resolve version conflicts whereas DynamoDB has a single master design. DynamoDB was announced by Amazon CTO [[Werner Vogels]] on January 18, 2012.&lt;ref name='Vogels 2012-01-18'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2012/01/amazon-dynamodb.html | title = http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2012/01/amazon-dynamodb.html | title = Amazon DynamoDB â€“ a Fast and Scalable NoSQL Database Service Designed for Internet Scale Applications | accessdate = 2012-01-21 | last = Vogels | first = Werner | date = 2012-01-18 | work = All Things Distributed blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
DynamoDB differs from other Amazon services by allowing developers to purchase a service based on [[throughput]], rather than [[computer data storage|storage]]. Although the database does not automatically [[Scalability|scale]], administrators can request more throughput and DynamoDB will spread the data and traffic over a number of servers using [[solid-state drive]]s, allowing predictable performance.&lt;ref name='ZDNet 2012-01-19'/&gt; It offers integration with [[Hadoop]] via  [[Amazon Elastic MapReduce|Elastic MapReduce]].

DynamoDB is [[proprietary software]], but has been compared to a managed version of the [[open-source software]] database [[Apache Cassandra]].&lt;ref name='Datastax 2012-01-18'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/amazon-dynamodb | title = Amazon DynamoDB | accessdate = 2012-01-21 | last = Ellis | first = Jonathan | date = 2012-01-18 | work = Cassandra Developer Center | publisher = Datastax.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language bindings==
Languages with DynamoDB [[language binding|binding]] include [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Node.js]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/04/amazon-dynamodb-libraries-mappers-and-mock-implementations-galore.html Amazon DynamoDB Libraries, Mappers, and Mock Implementations Galore!]&lt;/ref&gt;
