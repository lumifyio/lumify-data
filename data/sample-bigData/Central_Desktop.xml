The company's primary focus is providing a Software-as-a-Service collaboration tool to small and medium-sized businesses. The company and its products are most often compared to other wiki-based and project-centric solutions such as [[SharePoint]] and [[Basecamp (software)|Basecamp]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206101113&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2009, the company serves more than 375,000 users worldwide with customers such as [[Gymboree]], [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]], [[CBS]], [[Ritz-Carlton|The Ritz-Carlton]], [[Netflix]] and [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcworld.com/article/189948/central_desktops_20_upgrade_focuses_on_user_interface.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The company was founded by CEO Isaac Garcia and CTO Arnulf Hsu in 2005. Prior to founding Central Desktop, Isaac and Arnulf started Upgradebase in 1997, a product data provider to the computer and consumer electronics industry, and Vendorbase in 1999, a B2B marketplace for computer resellers. Both companies were acquired by [[CNET Networks]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sramanamitra.com/2009/02/03/central-desktop/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2006, the company accused [[Google]] of unfairly competing against its own customers by bidding on keywords that Google held an interest in.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdblog.centraldesktop.com/2006/12/googles-silent-monopoly-or-how.html&lt;/ref&gt; Google responded to the accusations on its own [[AdWords]] blog.&lt;ref&gt;http://adwords.blogspot.com/2006/12/google-advertising-on-adwords.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Central Desktop received $7 million in first round funding from [[OpenView Venture Partners]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.openviewpartners.com&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://techcrunch.com/2008/04/16/central-desktop-takes-7-million/&lt;/ref&gt;
