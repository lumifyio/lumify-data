:({{Find sources|Hadoop Hive}})
This article is written as a [[WP:NOT#HOWTO|how-to]], with no independent sources or valid coverage at all. Seems like an unremarkable piece of software, but moreover it is not written in an encyclopedic tone. Also, everything is hyperlinked, including text like "go to (some url)"; so this appears to be borderline [[WP:ADVERT]]. Further proof of advertising: ''Cloudera... has excellent training videos...'' &amp;mdash; &lt;small&gt;[[User:Timneu22|Timneu22]]&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#32; [[User talk:Timneu22|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:46, 22 July 2010 (UTC)

* Fixed some of the issues that you raised, and I hope that this will help you consider this article a legitimate entry.  The technology is certainly not unremarkable, and is currently in use by many cutting-edge companies.  I intend for this article to be expanded upon by others working with Hive, and have only laid the groundwork for someone to get a basic insight into Hive. &lt;small&gt;[[User:Patrickmccoy|Patrickmccoy]]&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#32; [[User talk:Patrickmccoy|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:48, 22 July 2010 (UTC)
*# "In order to install hive"... see [[WP:NOT#HOWTO]], which was already mentioned. &amp;mdash; &lt;small&gt;[[User:Timneu22|Timneu22]]&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#32; [[User talk:Timneu22|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:58, 22 July 2010 (UTC)

* '''Comment'''. Look, I believe you're trying, but the article is just nowhere close to being a valid encyclopedia topic. I can't go over every sentence and tell you what to correct. (Here's one: Once configured, Hive provides a really easy to use and understand SQL-like interface.) There are grammatical problems, tone problems, advertising problems, but overall, ''you just haven't provided any sources for this''. [[WP:N]]. &amp;mdash; &lt;small&gt;[[User:Timneu22|Timneu22]]&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#32; [[User talk:Timneu22|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:17, 22 July 2010 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' to [[Hadoop]]. Without [[WP:RS]] there can't be a standalone article. Suggest finding a source or three and summarize a single para. [[User:Eddie.willers|Eddie.willers]] ([[User talk:Eddie.willers|talk]]) 23:24, 22 July 2010 (UTC)
*&lt;small class="delsort-notice"&gt;'''Note''':  This debate has been included in the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Software|list of Software-related deletion discussions]]. &lt;!--Template:Deletion sorting--&gt;&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;-- [[User:Gene93k|• Gene93k]] ([[User talk:Gene93k|talk]]) 01:58, 24 July 2010 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
*'''Delete''' don't merge. The proposed merge target is inappropriate subject matter for this material. Hadoop is framework. Hive is product using the framework. If this material non-notable and promotional the proposed merge target would give wider exposure to the audience it seeks - that is a second bad reason to merge.

*'''Delete''', don't merge.  This product would seem to be an independent product that just happens to be built on the Hadoop chassis, and as such there's nothing to merge to the main article. - [[User:Ihcoyc|Smerdis of Tlön]] - [[User talk:Ihcoyc|killing the human spirit since 2003!]] 14:58, 29 July 2010 (UTC)
