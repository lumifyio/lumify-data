'''PureSystems''' is an [[IBM]] product line of factory pre-configured components and [[Server (computing)|server]]s also being referred to as an "Expert Integrated System".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/cloudline/2012/04/ibmpuresystems/ IBM Aims to Ease IT With Cloud-Friendly PureSystems] April 11, 2012 at ''WIRED Cloudline''&lt;/ref&gt; The centrepiece of PureSystems is the ''IBM Flex System Manager'' in tandem with the so-called "Patterns of Expertise" for the automated configuration and management of PureSystems.

PureSystems can host four different operating systems ([[AIX]], [[IBM i]], [[Linux]], [[Windows]]) and five [[hypervisor]]s ([[Hyper-V]], [[Kernel-based Virtual Machine|KVM]], [[PowerVM]], [[VMware]], [[Xen]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/ibm-launches-puresystems-touts-integration-flexibility/73564 IBM launches PureSystems, touts integration, flexibility] April 10, 2012 at ''zdnet.com''&lt;/ref&gt; on two different hardware architectures ([[Power Architecture]] and [[x86]]) simultaneously.

Being a so-called [[Converged infrastructure|converged system]], PureSystems combines functionality of an [[Computer appliance|appliance]] with the flexibility of an arbitrarily scalable system.

== Architecture ==
The architecture itself is called '''IBM Flex System'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/tips0863.html IBM RedBooks WebDoc - IBM Flex System Enterprise Chassis]  April 11, 2012 at ''redbooks.ibm.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

It aims at managing hybrid cloud infrastructure environments "out of the box".

The basic intention is for the combination of integrated hardware and software that can be easily maintained. A similar concept had already been introduced with the [[IBM AS/400]]. Today, such systems are called [[Converged infrastructure|converged system]]s. More specialized integrated hardware and software are referred to as [[Computer appliance|appliances]].

The compute [[Node (networking)|nodes]] of the [[server blade]]s can be [[x86]] or [[Power Architecture]] and they can be used either individually or mixed in the same rack simultaneously, thus offering a hybrid ensemble which borrows from the [[IBM zEnterprise System|zEnterprise]]/[[IBM zEnterprise System#BladeCenter Extension (zBX)|zBX]] ensemble&lt;ref&gt;[http://dancingdinosaur.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/ibm-puresystems-hint-at-the-future-of-zenterprise/ IBM PureSystems Hint at the Future of zEnterprise] April 16, 2012 at ''DancingDinosaur.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dancingdinosaur.wordpress.com/2012/05/08/puresystems-joins-zenterprise-hybrid-family/ PureSystems Joins zEnterprise Hybrid Family] May 8, 2012 at ''DancingDinosaur.com''&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Gameframe]]), including its ability to manage a combined physical/virtual hybrid environment from a single console.

PureSystems is shipped with the '''IBM Flex System Manager'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/Redbooks.nsf/RedbookAbstracts/tips0862.html?Open IBM RedBooks WebDoc - IBM Flex System Manager] at ''redbooks.ibm.com''&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[Computer appliance|appliance]] which manages the resources according to the so-called "Patterns of Expertise", which provide field engineers' expertise from decades of system configuration.
These "Patterns of Expertise" offer industry-specific (e.g. banking, insurance, automotive) defaults for the fully automatic and optimal orchestration of resources (e.g. workload balancing). PureApplication uses in conjunction with the IBM System Manager first Flex repeatable software patterns (pattern) and industry-specific processes, which are derived from the year-long collaboration of IBM with their customers and business partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelbiz.co.uk/2012/04/11/ibm-launches-puresystems-range/ IBM launches PureSystems range] April 11, 2012 at ''ChannelBiz.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware ==
The basic building block of the system is the 10U high Flex Enterprise system chassis with 14 bays in the front for compute nodes ("servers") and storage nodes.  Additionally, there are bays in the rear for I/O modules.

A flex-chassis can accommodate up to 14 horizontal compute and storage nodes in the front, and 4 vertically-oriented switch modules in the rear. Contrasting to this, the [[IBM BladeCenter]] (9U high) has vertically oriented compute nodes ("blades"). This means that the components between the BladeCenter chassis and Flex chassis are not interchangeable.

Based upon the Flex Systems architecture (the components of which are individually available), there are three main products:
* PureFlex System ([[IaaS]])
* PureApplication System ([[PaaS]])
* PureData System (tightly coupled and specialized [[computer appliance]] / [[software appliance]])

===PureFlex===
'''PureFlex''' is a factory pre-configured and combined hardware-/software system for [[IaaS]] in terms of [[cloud computing]]. It combines server, network and storage. IBM PureFlex is available in three configurations: Express, Standard, Enterprise.

=== PureApplication ===
'''PureApplication''' is an even further pre-configured platform for [[PaaS]] solutions. It is optimized for transaction-oriented web and database applications. PureApplication comes with [[IBM DB2]] database and [[WebSphere Application Server]] pre-configured so users can run their applications into a preconfigured middleware engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2012/09/12/taming-it-bastardization-with-ibm-puresystems-regardless-of-app-parentage/ Taming IT Bastardization with IBM PureSystem Regardless of App Parentage] Sept 12, 2012 at ''forbes.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike PureFlex, which is sold by [[IBM Systems and Technology Group (STG)]], PureApplication is marketed by the [[IBM Software Group (SWG)]].
IBM claims that PureApplication allows for installation (or deployment) of new applications within four hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os-sAK12jmE IBM PureApplication System -- The 4 hour set-up by Jason McGee] at ''youtube.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM PureApplication System is available in three classes:
* W1500-32 and W1500-64, using Intel Xeon E5-2670 processors, housed in a 25U rack
* W1500-96 through to W1500-608, using [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors#"Sandy Bridge-EP" (32 nm) Efficient Performance|Intel Xeon E5-2670]]  processors, housed in a 42U rack
* W1700-96 through to W1700-608, using [[IBM POWER microprocessors#POWER7 processors|IBM POWER7+]] processors, housed in a 42U rack

===PureData===
PureData Systems takes the approach of PureApplication a step further being essentially a tightly coupled and specialized [[computer appliance]] and [[software appliance]], the latter supporting both [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] and [[IBM DB2|DB2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serverwatch.com/server-news/ibm-rolls-out-new-puresystems-data-servers.html IBM Rolls Out New PureSystems Data Servers] by Sean M. Kerner, Oct 9, 2012 at ''serverwatch.com''&lt;/ref&gt; It is thence marketed by the [[IBM Information Management Software]], a brand of [[IBM Software Group (SWG)]].

PureData is focused at three main tasks within enterprise computing: business intelligence, near real-time data analysis and online transactional processing.&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;[https://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9232209/IBM_expands_PureSystems_line_for_data_duties IBM expands PureSystems line for data duties] by Joab Jackson, Oct 9, 2012 at ''computerworld.com''&lt;/ref&gt;
It comes in four flavours:&lt;ref name="eweek"&gt;[http://www.eweek.com/enterprise-apps/ibm-expands-puresystems-family-with-new-puredata-big-data-box/ IBM Expands PureSystems Family With New PureData Big Data Box] by Darryl K. Taft, Oct 9, 2012 at ''eweek.com''&lt;/ref&gt;
* PureData Systems for Transactions
* PureData Systems for Analytics
* PureData Systems for Operational Analytics
* PureData Systems for [[Hadoop]]

PureData System for Transactions is a highly reliable and scalable database platform.  It is aimed at [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]] [i.e. retail and credit card processing environments) which depends on rapid handling of transactions and interactions. These transactions are small in size, but their sheer volume and frequency require a specialized environment. The new system can provide 5x performance improvement, partly through advances in high performance storage.

PureData System for Analytics builds on [[Netezza]] technology and it is aimed at [[business intelligence]] that entails huge queries with complex algorithms. It provides a large library of database analytical functions for [[data warehouse]] applications, and can scale across the terabyte or petabytes running on the system. It can support extremely high volume high speed analytics for clients (e.g. mobile phone carriers who want to identify potential churn and provide offers to retain customers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2012/10/09/ibm-launches-new-puresystems-for-transactions-and-big-data-analytics/ IBM Launches New PureSystems For Transactions And Big Data Analytics] by Tom Groenfeldt, Oct 9, 2012 at ''forbes.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

PureData Systems for Operational Analytics is an [[operational system|operational warehouse system]]&lt;ref name="eweek"/&gt; which supports [[Real-time data|real-time]] decision making. In contrast to PureData System for Analytics, which is aimed at handling large sets of data at a time, PureData for Operational Analytics is more or less a [[stream computing]] system that can analyze many small sets of data in real-time while PureData for Analytics will provide analysis only in hindsight but with large sets of data, though.
Potential uses of PureData Systems for Operational Analytics are fraud detection or analysis of rapid fluctuations in supply-and-demand cycles.&lt;ref name="cw"/&gt;

PureData Systems for Hadoop H 1001 is a standards-based - so-called expert integrated - system which architecturally integrates [[IBM InfoSphere|IBM InfoSphere BigInsights]], Hadoop-based software, server ([[IBM System x]]), and storage into a single appliance. Moreover, it integrates with [[IBM DB2]], [[Netezza|IBM Netezza]], IBM PureData System for Analytics, and [[IBM InfoSphere|IBM InfoSphere Guardium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/focus/archive/2013/04/ibm-tackles-big-data-big-hardware-puredata-system-hadoop-0 IBM Tackles Big Data with Big Hardware - PureData System for HADOOP], Apr 3, 2013 at ''datacenterdynamics.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software ==
Both IBM and its partners provide software which is specifically certified for PureSystems ("Ready for IBM PureSystems ").

Currently, over 125 [[Independent Software Vendor|ISV]]s have already certified products for PureSystems, and business partners such as system integrators, resellers, distributors, ISVs or [[Managed service provider|MSP]] can integrate PureSystems into their portfolio.

== Miscellaneous ==
PureSystems was [http://www.smartercomputingblog.com/2012/04/12/ibm-puresystems-launch-a-picture-book-storify/ announced] April 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/37399.wss IBM Sets the Stage for the Next Era of Computing] April 11, 2012 at ''ibm.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

It was mainly assembled at [[IBM Rochester|IBM Rochester Campus]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], MN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itjungle.com/tfh/tfh042312-story08.html IT-Jungle Volume 21, Number 16] April 23, 2012 at ''itjungle.com''&lt;/ref&gt;
But on March 6,2013, IBM decided to shift production of Power Systems, PureSystems and PureFlex Systems servers to [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]] from [[Rochester, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2013/03/06/ibm-moving-rochester-production-to-mexico-ny IBM moving Rochester production to NY, Mexico] March 6, 2013 at ''MPRNews''&lt;/ref&gt; After 2014, most systems will be assembled in Mexico.
