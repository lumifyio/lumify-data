The '''Symmetrix''' system is [[EMC Corporation]]'s flagship [[enterprise storage]] [[disk array|array]].  The Symmetrix development has been led by [[Moshe Yanai]], who joined EMC in 1987, until shortly before his leaving EMC in 2001. 

== History ==
Symmetrix arrays, EMC's flagship product at that time, began shipping in 1990 as an IBM Mainframe Block Multiplex Channel - (aka Bus and Tag) connected storage array.  Newer generations of Symmetrix brought additional host connection protocols which include [[ESCON]], [[SCSI]], [[Fibre Channel]]-based [[Storage area network|SAN]]s, [[FICON]] and [[iSCSI]]. The Symmetrix product was initially popular within the airline industry and with companies that were willing to deviate from the safety of IBM's 3390 disk subsystem and take a risk with the unproven Symmetrix array. The Symmetrix has been developed by a team led by [[Moshe Yanai]]. This product is the main reason for the rapid growth of EMC in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company valued hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion company.&lt;ref&gt;EMC Company Web site, July 19, 2000 [http://www.emc.com/about/news/press/us/earnings/20000719-469.htm "EMC Reports 43% Growth in Storage Revenue, First $2 Billion Quarter"] Retrieved October 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Moshe Yanai managed the Symmetrix development from the product's inception in the late 1980s until shortly before leaving EMC in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;EMC Company Web site, November 29, 2001 [http://www.emc.com/about/news/press/us/2001/20011129-1164.htm "EMC Strengthens Operational Alignment"] Retrieved October 24, 2010; see paragraph about [[Moshe Yanai]].&lt;/ref&gt; and his Symmetrix development team grew from several people to thousands.

== Symmetrix VMAX ==
EMC Symmetrix V-Max systems are enterprise-class storage platforms intended for open systems and mainframe computing. Symmetrix V-Max systems run Enginuity operating environment

The system scales from a single Symmetrix V-Max Engine system with one storage bay to a large eight engine system and a maximum of ten storage bays.

The VMAX system bay has 1-8 Engines. These engines house all the hardware for the entire data processing capabilities. Each Engine contains 2 director boards, Memory Chips, Front end and back end ports for connectivity to hosts and storage bays. 

Each Director board contains 2 Intel quad core processors for data processing, 16, 32 or 64 GB of physical memory, One System Interface Board (SIB) that connects the director to the Matrix Interface Board Enclosure (MIBE), Front end and back end ports.

The VMAX has 1 to 10 storage bays, Hard drives are installed in the storage bays, Each Storage bay contains 16 Disk Array Enclosures (DAE). Each DAE contains 15-25 hard drives. The VMAX supports SATA, Fiber Channel, SAS and Solid State drives.
