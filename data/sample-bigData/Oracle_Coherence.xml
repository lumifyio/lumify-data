      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[computing]], '''[[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] Coherence''' is a [[Java (software platform)|Java]]-based [[In-memory database|in-memory]] [[data grid]] designed to improve reliability, scalability and performance compared to traditional [[relational database management systems]].

Coherence provides several core services:
* [[Replication (computing)|Replicated]] and partitioned data management and caching services -   At its core Oracle Coherence is a highly scalable and [[Fault-tolerant computer system|fault-tolerant]] distributed cache engine.  Coherence uses a specialized scalable [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] and many inexpensive computers to create a [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]] which can be seamlessly expanded to add more memory, processing power or both. As a result Coherence has no [[single point of failure]] and transparently [[failover|fails over]] if a cluster member fails. When a Coherence server is added or removed the cluster automatically re-balances to share the workload. As a result Coherence provides a highly available and predictably horizontally scalable infrastructure for managing application data.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/coherence/overview/index.html Oracle Coherence Product Page]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Replicated data processing engine - In addition to caching Coherence provides a rich data processing model so processing can be farmed out to where the data is, and results returned back to the client.  By moving the processing to the data, processing too is highly scalable. This is to some extent similar to a [[MapReduce]] framework, but lacks the option of parallel reductions. &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.cfelde.com/2012/12/oracle-coherence-and-mapreduce/ Oracle Coherence and MapReduce]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Event (computing)|Event]] model allowing developers to interact with data as it changes. 
* Support for clients written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C++]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]] as well as other languages using [[Representational State Transfer]] (REST).

In addition Coherence provides a variety of mechanisms to integrate with other services using [[TopLink]], [[Java Persistence API]], Oracle Golden Gate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/data-integration/goldengate/overview/index.html |title=Oracle GoldenGate |publisher=Oracle.com |date=2012-10-24 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or almost any other platform using Coherence provided [[Application Programming Interface|APIs]].

Coherence can be used to manage [[HTTP]] [[Session (computer science)|sessions]] via Coherence*Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coherence.oracle.com/display/COH34UG/Coherence*Web+Session+Management+Module |title=Coherence*Web Session Management Module - Coherence 3.4 User Guide - Oracle Coherence Knowledge Base |publisher=Coherence.oracle.com |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With Coherence*Web, application services such as [[WebLogic|Oracle WebLogic Server]], [[IBM WebSphere]], [[Apache Tomcat]] and others can reap the same benefits of performance, fault tolerance, and scalability as data.

Some Coherence usage patterns are [[open source]] and are listed and supported though the Oracle Coherence incubator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coherence.oracle.com/display/INCUBATOR/Home Coherence Incubator]&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns implement features such as messaging, work distribution and data replication across [[wide area network]]s with Coherence.

Tangosol Inc. developed the original Coherence product. Oracle Corporation acquired Tangosol in April 2007, when Coherence had about 120 direct customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2007_mar/tangosol.html Oracle acquires Tangosol]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also embedded in a few products from companies that included some of Oracle's competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/resources/147600/147673/oracle_to_acquire_a_lead_in__147673.pdf Oracle to Acquire a Lead in Extreme Transaction Processing]&lt;/ref&gt;
