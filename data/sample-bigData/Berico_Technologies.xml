== Bank of America and WikiLeaks ==
In February 2011 the name of Berico, along with [[HBGary]] and [[Palantir Technologies]] were allegedly found on a plan for [[Bank of America]] to respond to a [[WikiLeaks]] dump of the banks documents. The plan allegedly involved 'disrupting' ''[[Salon.com]]'' reporter [[Glenn Greenwald]]'s support of [[WikiLeaks]].

On Feb 11, 2011 the CEO and COO of Berico released a statement on the matter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Our leadership does not condone or support any effort that proactively targets American firms, organizations or individuals. We find such actions reprehensible and are deeply committed to partnering with the best companies in our industry that share our core values. Therefore, we have discontinued all ties with HBGary Federal. We are conducting a thorough internal investigation to better understand the details of how this situation unfolded and we will take the appropriate actions within our company."''&lt;ref name="saloncom2"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
