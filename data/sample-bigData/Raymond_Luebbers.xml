      <text xml:space="preserve">Dr. '''Raymond J. Luebbers''' was Professor of Electrical Engineering at [[The Pennsylvania State University]] and [[Ohio University]], a Research Scientist at the [[Lockheed Martin]] Research Laboratory in [[Palo Alto, CA]] and founder of Remcom, Inc.

==Education and academic career==
Luebbers received the B.S.E.E. from the [[University of Cincinnati]] with High Honors, and M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[The Ohio State University]]. He In 1984 he joined the Electrical Engineering Department of [[The Pennsylvania State University]]. During the 1991-1992 academic year he was an [[National Science Foundation]] Visiting Professor in the Faculty of Engineering, [[Tohoku University]], [[Sendai, Japan]].

==Remcom==
While a professor at [[The Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] he founded Remcom, Inc, a company which develops of commercial [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] analysis software. In December 2001 he resigned from [[The Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], retaining the title of Adjunct Professor.

Remcom also performs research and development under contract to government and industry. 

It has won awards for innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2009/10/31/1601180/8-local-firms-to-share-1-million.html |title=8 local firms to share $1 million |publisher=The Centre Daily Times |date=2009-10-31 |accessdate=2010-05-16}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.remcom.com/examples/keyless-entry.html |title=Keyless Entry |publisher=Remcom |date=2010-04-14 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.remcom.com/meet-remcom-employees/h-scott-langdon-corporate-chief-technology-officer-product-m.html |title=H.

==Research and writing==
Luebbers has published in the areas of analysis of frequency selective surfaces, applications of the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction, and applications and extensions of the [[Finite-difference time-domain method]]. He is co-author of a book called The Finite Difference Time Domain Method for Electromagnetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcpress.com/ecommerce_product/product_detail.jsf?catno=8657&amp;isbn=0000000000000&amp;af=W1129 |title=The Finite Difference Time Domain Method for Electromagnetics |publisher=CRC Press |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=00on9fRvJqIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+finite+difference+time+domain+method+for+electromagnetics&amp;ei=IHDfS42qJ46WzgTK-ti4CQ&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The finite difference time domain method for electromagnetics By Karl S.

The paper "FDTD Calculation of Scattering from Frequency-Dependent Materials," by R. Luebbers, D. Steich, and K. Kunz, received the 1993 Schelkunoff Best Paper Award of the [[IEEE]] Antennas and Propagation Society.

He has served on the Board of Directors and as Vice-President of the Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society (ACES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aces.ee.olemiss.edu/history.php |title=ACES History |publisher=The Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Member of International Union of Radio Science (URSI) Commission B, and is a member of [[IEEE]] Standards Coordinating Committee 34 on Electromagnetic Energy Product Performance Safety.
