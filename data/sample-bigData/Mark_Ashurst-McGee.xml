In 1999, Ashurst-McGee was an intern in the Church Archives of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ashurst-McGee, Mark | title=The Josiah Stowell Jr.-John S. Fullmer Correspondence | journal=[[BYU Studies]] | volume=38 | issue=3 | year=1999 | pages=108–117 | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/byustudies,2048 | accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his time at ASU, he joined the staff of the [[Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History]] at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref name=h-amindian/&gt;  He also worked as an editor for [[Deseret Book]] and published articles with the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mark Ashurst-McGee | work=Authors | publisher=[[Maxwell Institute]] | url=http://farms.byu.edu/authors/?authorID=481 | accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mormon History Association]].&lt;ref name=MAMpapers/&gt;

When FARMS printed a coordinated critique of [[Grant Palmer]]'s controversial 2002 book, ''[[An Insider's View of Mormon Origins]]'', Ashurst-McGee wrote one of the five critiques published in the ''[[FARMS Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A One-sided View of Mormon Origins | author=Ashurst-McGee, Mark | journal=[[FARMS Review]] | publisher=[[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] | year=2003 | volume=15 | issue=2 | url=http://farms.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=15&amp;num=2&amp;id=513 | accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other reviewers were [[James B. Allen (historian)|James B. Allen]], [[Davis Bitton]], [[Louis Midgley]], and [[Steven C. Harper]].  

Ashurst-McGee is a member of the Joseph Smith Papers Project.  Along with [[Richard L. Jensen]] and [[Dean C. Jessee]], he co-edited the first volume to be published from the series, which was on the early journals of [[Joseph Smith]].  Released in 2008, the book became very popular and sold very quickly, prompting expanded additional printings.  In 2009, it received the Steven F. Christensen Best Documentary Award (Mormon History Association) and a Special Award in Textual Criticism and Bibliography ([[Association for Mormon Letters]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=News, Reviews, and Endorsements | date=July 8, 2009 | publisher=The Joseph Smith Papers | url=http://josephsmithpapers.org/News.htm | accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ashurst-McGee is expected to edit future volumes of Smith's papers.
