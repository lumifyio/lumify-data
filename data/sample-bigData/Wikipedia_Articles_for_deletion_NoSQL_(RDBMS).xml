Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links in order to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. --&gt;

The result was    '''no consensus'''. sfter several relistings, there still does not seem to be consensus. AfDs have to end at some point.  '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 03:46, 3 September 2011 (UTC)

While [[NoSQL]] is [[WP:N|notable]], this implementation of it is not — indeed the only non-[[WP:SPS]] is an [[WP:RS|unreliable]] blog post. Furthermore the article, by going into philosophy et al, is confusing for readers — as evidenced by unilateral moves being reverted by community consensus. -- &lt;u style="text-decoration:none; font-family: papyrus;"&gt;[[User:SamJohnston|samj]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color="maroon"&gt;[[User talk:Samj|in]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;[[Special:Contributions/SamJohnston|out]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 03:12, 7 August 2011 (UTC)

:*I'm unconvinced — this is merely a tutorial that does not give value judgment on the product or why it should be considered notable. Inclusion with its ill-conceived and conflicting name is going to cause more confusion for the vast majority of readers. Also, what's up with "RDBMS" in the title of a non-relational database? -- &lt;u style="text-decoration:none; font-family: papyrus;"&gt;[[User:SamJohnston|samj]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color="maroon"&gt;[[User talk:Samj|in]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;[[Special:Contributions/SamJohnston|out]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 11:03, 19 August 2011 (UTC)
::*It is enough that the column covers the topic in depth (i.e. is "[[WP:GNG|significant coverage]]") and is from a reliable third-party publication. If we admit one of the other 2 Further Readings, then the GNG has (unfortunately) been satisfied. The NoSQL in question is not a non-relational database; it ''predates'' the modern buzzword, and its name merely means that it does not use the Structured Query Language for specifying its queries. --[[User:Cybercobra|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="3773A5"&gt;Cyber&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color="FFB521"&gt;cobra&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Cybercobra|(talk)]] 05:01, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
:::* Proving my point, even I'm confused — NoSQL (RDBMS) *is* actually an RDBMS according to the article.

* Please keep the article.  But yes, there's an important distinction between NoSQL, the concept of databases beyond relational, and the NoSQL product in particular.  I'm currently searching for a job and a lot of the job listings request expertise in NoSQL.  (which I don't have.  But it's really good to get a quick overview here in WP so I know what the heck they are talking about.)  Cut out inappropriate parts maybe.  But yeah, the product does not fall within the concept, and the name suffix (RDBMS) is wrong, as it is not an RDBMS.  It is, however, a DBMS, as DBMS is a more general concept.  I'll add something that will probably be soon deleted.  :-|   Somebody else can rename it.  please.

:* '''Comment''': I think you're looking for the [[NoSQL]] article, which already covers the topic you're looking for well (and just goes to demonstrate the confusion this article causes). -- &lt;u style="text-decoration:none; font-family: papyrus;"&gt;[[User:SamJohnston|samj]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color="maroon"&gt;[[User talk:Samj|in]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;[[Special:Contributions/SamJohnston|out]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 14:56, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

*'''Comment''': I have removed unreliable, irrelevant and self-published inline references and found that there were no reliable inline references whatsoever. Of the 3 articles listed under "Further reading", only one is from a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] and even then it did not actually appear in the printed journal (rather "[http://www.linuxjournal.com/issue/67 Strictly On-Line]). There appears to be no doubt the subject is not notable today, and significant doubt as to whether it was even notable 10+ years ago. I strongly believe that our readers would be better served if this article were deleted — it is essentially just a replica of content available on the official site anyway (so much so that I would consider the [[NoSQL_(RDBMS)#Philosophy|Philosophy]] section to be a [[WP:COPYVIO]] of [http://www.strozzi.it/cgi-bin/CSA/tw7/I/en_US/NoSQL/Philosophy%20of%20NoSQL this] at least). -- &lt;u style="text-decoration:none; font-family: papyrus;"&gt;[[User:SamJohnston|samj]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color="maroon"&gt;[[User talk:Samj|in]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;[[Special:Contributions/SamJohnston|out]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 15:04, 29 August 2011 (UTC)
