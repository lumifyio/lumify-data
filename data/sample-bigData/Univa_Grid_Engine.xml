'''Univa Grid Engine''' is a [[batch-queuing system]], forked from [[Sun Grid Engine]] (SGE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hpcinthecloud.com/features/Grid-Engine-Finds-Safe-Harbor-in-Univa-114125534.html | title=Grid Engine Finds Safe Harbor at Univa | work=HPC in the Cloud | date=2011-01-18 | accessdate=April 17, 2011 | author=Gentzsch, Wolfgang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/18/univa_forks_oracle_grid_engine/ | title=Univa forks Oracle's Sun Grid Engine | work=The Register | date=2011-01-18 | accessdate=April 17, 2011 | author=Morgan, Timothy Prickett}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hpcwire.com/features/Univa-Rescues-Grid-Engine-From-Oracle-114140804.html | title=Univa Rescues Grid Engine From Oracle | work=HPCwire | date=2011-01-18 | accessdate=April 17, 2011 | author=Feldman, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The roots of Grid Engine as a commercial product date back to 1993 (under the names CODINE and later, in a variation of the product, GRD). A more comprehensive genealogy of the product is described in [[Sun Grid Engine]]. Grid Engine was first distributed by Genias Software and from 1999, after a company merger, by Gridware In. In 2000, [[Sun Microsystems]] acquired Gridware, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2000-07/sunflash.20000724.3.xml|title=Gridware's resource management software increases efficiency and productivity in compute-intensive technical computing environments|date=2000-07-24|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sun renamed CODINE/GRD as Sun Grid Engine later that year, and released it as [[open source]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2001-07/sunflash.20010723.1.xml|title=Sun Microsystems makes SUN GRID ENGINE software available to open source community|date=2001-07-23|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Oracle Corporation]] acquired Sun and thus renamed SGE to [[Oracle Grid Engine]].  The Oracle Grid Engine 6.2u6 source code was not included with the binaries, and changes were not put back to the project's source repository.  In response to this, the Grid Engine community started the ''Open Grid Scheduler'' and the ''Son of Grid Engine'' projects to continue to develop and maintain a free implementation of Grid Engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/gridscheduler/ Open Grid Scheduler]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arc.liv.ac.uk/trac/SGE Son of Grid Engine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7850|title=The State of Oracle/Sun Grid Engine|first=Douglas|last=Eadline, Ph.D.|date=September 1, 2010|accessdate=2011-01-18|publisher=Linux Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markmail.org/message/hcxond5s4cywe5dv|title=Changes for a Bright Future at Oracle|first=Daniel|last=Templeton|date=2010-12-23|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2011, [[Univa]] announced that it had hired the principal engineers from the Sun Grid Engine team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.univa.com/news/Univa-Acquires-Grid-Engine-Expertise | title=Univa Acquires Grid Engine Expertise | publisher=Univa | date=2011-01-18 | accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Univa Grid Engine development is led by CTO Fritz Ferstl, who founded the Grid Engine project and ran the business within Sun/Oracle for the past 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.univa.com/about/bio-ferstl | title=Biography of Fritz Ferstl | publisher=Univa | accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Releases ==
Univa Grid Engine 8.0 was the first version, released on April 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110412005977/en/Univa-Grid-Engine-8.0 | title=Univa Grid Engine 8.0 Now Available | publisher=Univa | date=2011-04-12 | accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from SGE 6.2u5, the last open source release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wheregridenginelives.com/content/rebirth-continuity-and-expansion-univa-grid-engine-v80 | title=Rebirth, Continuity and Expansion - Univa Grid Engine v8.0 | publisher=Univa | date=2011-04-12 | accessdate=April 17, 2011 | author=Ferstl, Fritz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It adds improved third party application integration, license and policy management, enhanced support for software and hardware platforms, and cloud management tools.

Univa Grid Engine 8.0.1 was released on October 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.univa.com/news/univa-widens-grid-engine-gap | title=Univa Widens Grid Engine Gap | publisher=Univa | date=2011-10-04 | accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It adds improved support for multi-core hardware, integration with NVIDIA GPUs, new job submission verifier extensions, and additional bug fixes.

Univa Grid Engine 8.1.0 has been announced on May 2. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.univa.com/news/univa-announces-grid-engine-81-further-evolve-popular-software | title=Univa Announces Univa Grid Engine 8.1 | publisher=Univa | date=2012-05-02 | accessdate=May 02, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has updated it to the latest release level 8.1.3 in Nov 15 2012. The 8.1.x releases deliver important new functionality such as Job Classes, PostGres Spooling, Resource Maps, Fair Urgency, deterministic Wildcard PE Selection, improved Diagnostics, pre-configured MPI integations and improved Apache Hadoop Integration &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.univa.com/resources/integration-for-hadoop.php | title=Univa Grid Engine Integration for Hadoop | publisher=Univa}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many bug fixes and performance improvements.
