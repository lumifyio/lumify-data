'''The Maniaks''' are a [[fictional]] [[rock band]] published by [[DC Comics]]. They first appeared in issue ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #68 (May 1967), and were created by [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]].

==History==
The Maniaks were created in the mold of TV's [[the Monkees]]--a band that would also get involved in wild adventures, often on the way to their gigs.  The band would meet fictionalized versions of famous celebrities, such as "Jeannette Punchinello" ([[Annette Funicello]]), "Rock Hutsut" ([[Rock Hudson]]), and "Twiggly" ([[Twiggy]]).  An exception was comedian [[Woody Allen]], who appeared in an unfictionalized form in ''Showcase'' #71.

===Power Company===

The Maniaks as a band made no further appearances after ''Showcase'' #71.  Silver Shannon later appeared in ''The Power Company'' limited series, where she worked as a personal assistant to [[Josiah Power]].

In ''[[The Power of Shazam|The Power of Shazam #48]]'', a one-issue revival that tied into the [[Blackest Night]] event, [[Osiris (comics)|Amon Tomaz]] makes a brief reference to the Maniaks.
