'''Avro''' is a [[remote procedure call]] and [[serialization]] framework developed within Apache's Hadoop project. It uses [[JSON]] for defining data types and [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s, and serializes data in a compact binary format. In  other words, Avro is a data serialization system. Its primary use is in [[Hadoop|Apache Hadoop]], where it can provide both a serialization format for persistent data, and a wire format for communication between Hadoop nodes, and from client programs to the Hadoop [[service (systems architecture)|service]]s.

It is similar to [[Thrift (protocol)|Thrift]], but does not require running a code-generation program when a [[Database schema|schema]] changes (unless desired for [[statically-typed]] languages).

== Languages with APIs ==
Though theoretically any language could use Avro, the following languages have APIs written for them:&lt;ref&gt;http://github.com/phunt/avro-rpc-quickstart&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Java (programming language)|Java]]
* [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]&lt;ref&gt;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO/fixforversion/12316197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-533&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AVRO/Supported+Languages&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[C (programming language)|C]]
* [[C++]]
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
* [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]

== Avro IDL ==

In addition to supporting JSON for type and protocol definitions, Avro includes experimental&lt;ref&gt;http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/idl.html&lt;/ref&gt; support for an alternate [[interface description language]] (IDL) syntax known as Avro IDL.  Previously known as GenAvro, this format is designed to ease adoption by users familiar with more traditional IDLs and programming languages, with a syntax similar to C/C++, [[Protocol Buffers]] and others.
