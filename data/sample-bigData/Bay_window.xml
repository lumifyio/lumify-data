A '''bay window''' is a [[window]] space projecting outward from the main [[wall]]s of a building and forming a [[bay (architecture)|bay]] in a room. 

==Terminology and characteristics==
Bay window is a generic term for all protruding window constructions, regardless of whether they run over one or multiple [[storey]]s. They are most commonly [[polygonal]] or square in plan but may also be curved, in which case they may also be called [[bow window]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Fleming (art historian)|John Fleming]], [[Hugh Honour]], [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], The [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] Dictionary of Architecture, Fourth edition, [[Harmondsworth]] 1991, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The angles most commonly used on the inside corners of the bay are 90, 135 and 150 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s. 
A canted bay window has a flat front and angled sides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalarchitecture.net/documents/glossary.pdf ''Glossary of Architectural Terms''] [[s.v.]] ''Bay Window''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In its most basic form, a bay window simply consists of two protruding windows, [[triangular]] in plan.

If a bay window does not rise from the ground and is instead supported by a [[corbel]], [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]] or similar it is called [[oriel window]].

While most bay windows protrude from a building, some bay windows are level with the exterior and are built into the interior of a room. 

==Uses==
Most [[medieval architecture|medieval]] bay windows and up to the [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] era are oriel windows. They frequently appear as a highly [[Ornament (art)|ornamented]] addition to the building rather than an organic part of it. Particularly during the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period they frequently contain small house [[chapel]]s, with the oriel window containing an [[altar]] and resembling an [[apse]] of a church. Especially in [[Nuremberg]] these are even called ''Chörlein'' (meaning ''Little Apse'' or ''Little Choir'') with the most famous example being the one from the [[parsonage]] of [[St. Sebaldus Church]].

[[Oriental]] oriel windows such as the [[Arab]] [[Mashrabiya]] are frequently made of wood and allow viewing out while restricting visibility from the outside. Because there is a close similarity to the use of a [[balcony]], it is difficult to define if they are indeed oriel windows or a special type of balcony. 

Bay windows became a hugely popular feature of residential [[Victorian architecture]] in the [[British Isles]] from about the 1870s and hold a continuous appeal up to this day. They are used to increase the flow of natural light into a building, thereby also making a room appear larger, and to provide views of the outside which would be unavailable with an ordinary flat window. They can be found in [[terraced house]]s, [[Semi-detached|semis]] and [[Single-family detached home|detached houses]] as well as in blocks of [[apartment|flats]]. 

Based on British models their use spread to other English speaking countries like the USA, Canada and Australia. Following the pioneering model of pre-modern commercial architecture at the [[Oriel Chambers]] in [[Liverpool]], they even feature on early [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School]] [[skyscraper]]s where they often run the whole height of the building's upper storeys. 
Bay windows were identified as a defining characteristic of [[San Francisco]] architecture in a 2012 study that had a [[machine learning]] algorithm examine a random sample of 25,000 photos of cities from [[Google Street View]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/cloud/big-data-magic-trick-show-me-a-doorway-ill-tell-you-the-city/ |title=Big data magic trick: Show me a doorway, I’ll tell you the city |first=Derrick |last=Harris |date=10 August 2012 |publisher=[[GigaOM]] |accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
