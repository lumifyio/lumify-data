'''Brian Aker''', born August 4, 1972 in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Kentucky]], [[United States|USA]] is an [[open-source]] [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] who has worked on various [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] modules, the [[Slash (weblog system)|Slash]] system, and numerous storage engines for the  [[MySQL]] database. Aker was Director of Architecture at [[MySQL AB]] until it was acquired by Sun Microsystems. He led Sun's web scaling research group, where he worked on the [[Drizzle (database server)|Drizzle database project]]. He later became a Distinguished Engineer for Sun Microsystems .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Livejournal |title=Second star to the right and straight on till morning|url=http://krow.livejournal.com/682519.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Sun Microsystems after Oracle acquired it. After leaving Sun Microsystems he became the CTO of Data Differential and provided support to open source projects such as libmemcached, [[Gearman]] and [[Drizzle (database server)|Drizzle database project]]. Aker is currently a Fellow and VP at [[Hewlett-Packard]], focusing on [[OpenStack]] and [[Cloud Computing]].

After graduating with triple majors in environmental science, computing and mathematics, from [[Antioch College]], Aker contributed to his first open source project, the [[386BSD]] [[operating system]]. He then moved to work on [[Slashdot]], where his initial task was to rewrite the database back-end to use [[Oracle database|Oracle]]. However, he extended the system to ensure it allowed multiple database back-ends, and became a published author along the way, writing ''Running Weblogs with Slash'' (ISBN 978-0596001001) with [[chromatic (programmer)|chromatic]] and Dave Krieger. From 2001 to 2007 he posted stories on Slashdot under the Author name of "Krow". 

Aker first involved himself with the MySQL project in 1998. In 2001 he released an early prototype of MySQL with Perl based functions and later went from [[VA Linux Systems]] to MySQL to lead development of the 4.1 and 5.0 versions of the MySQL Database Server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=O'Reilly |title=Audio Interview with Brian Aker on the Future of Databases |publisher=[[O'Reilly]] |url=http://news.oreilly.com/2008/06/brian-akers-vision-for-a-livab.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has presented projects integrating MySQL with a number of technologies, including a working version of MySQL with Java based functions with Eric Herman in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Slashdot |title=MySQL Gets Functions in Java |publisher=[[Slashdot]] |url=http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/19/1628241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aker has been known to offer a [[Perl]] Certification Course at the University of Washington. He has also worked on the [http://vh.org/ Virtual Hospital] project, providing the Internet's first medical website, while at the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics.   

While not traveling and presenting at about six open source related conferences a year, he resides in [[Seattle]], Washington. Some of the conferences Aker has presented at are [[O'Reilly Open Source Convention|OSCON]], [[Linuxfest Northwest]], [[Southern California Linux Expo]], and the MySQL Users Conference &amp; Expo. He is also the maintainer of the C client library for the [[Memcached]] server. He also maintains the current version of [[Gearman]].

He is a commentator on the prolific creation of [[NoSQL (concept)|NoSQL]] databases giving [[Ignite (event)|Ignite]] talks on its evolution.

A list of [[MySQL]] projects Brian Aker has created:
* The [[Drizzle (database server)|Drizzle Database]] server
* [[MySQL Archive|MySQL Archive Storage Engine]]
* [[MySQL Federated|MySQL Federated Storage Engine]]
* [[Memcache]]d Storage Engine
