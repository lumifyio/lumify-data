      <text xml:space="preserve">'''MapR''' is a [[San Jose, California]]-based enterprise software company that develops and sells [[Apache Hadoop]]-derived software.  The company contributes to [[Apache Hadoop]] projects like [[HBase]], [[Pig (programming language)]], [[Apache Hive]], and [[Apache ZooKeeper]].&lt;ref name="contrib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/cloud/why-mapr-is-right-to-give-back-to-apache-hadoop/|title=Why MapR is Right to Give Back to Apache Hadoop|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MapR's [[Apache Hadoop]] distribution claims to provide full data protection, no single points of failure, improved performance, and dramatic ease of use advantages. MapR entered a technology licensing agreement with [[EMC Corporation]] on 25 May 2011, supporting an EMC-specific distribution of [[Apache Hadoop]].&lt;ref name="emchadoop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msoftnews.com/google/startup-mapr-underpins-emc%E2%80%99s-hadoop-effort/|title=Startup MapR Underpins EMCâ€™s Hadoop Effort|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MapR was selected by Amazon to provide an upgraded version of Amazon's Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) service&lt;ref name="emr-mapr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/mapr/|title=Amazon EMR with the MapR Distribution for Hadoop|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emr-announce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/cloud/amazon-taps-mapr-for-high-powered-elastic-mapreduce/|title=Amazon Taps MapR for High Powered Elastic Map Reduce|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MapR has also been selected by Google as a technology partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MapR Technologies Joins Google Cloud Platform Partner Program|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/24/idUS189111+24-Jul-2012+BW20120724|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MapR was able to break the minute sort speed record on Google's compute platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Cade|title=Google Teams With Prodigal Son to Bust Data Sort Record|url=http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/02/google-mapr-data-sort-record/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MapR provides three versions of their product known as M3,  M5 and M7.  M3 is a free version of the M5 product with degraded availability features.  M7 is like M5, but adds a purpose built rewrite of HBase that implements the HBase API directly in the file-system layer.

MapR is privately held with original funding of $9 million from [[Lightspeed Venture Partners]] and [[New Enterprise Associates]] since 2009. Key MapR executives come from [[Google]], [[Lightspeed Venture Partners]], [[Informatica]], [[EMC Corporation]] and [[Veoh]].  MapR had an additional round of funding led by [[Redpoint]] in August, 2011.&lt;ref name="redpoint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/44325254/MapR_Technologies_Secures_20_Million_in_Funding_Investment_to_Fuel_Rapid_Adoption_for_Big_Data_Analytics_and_Hadoop|title=MapR Technologies Secures 20 million in Funding|accessdate=19 Sept 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
MapR provides a number of capabilities not available in standard Apache Hadoop.  These include NFS access, no single points of failure for any system service, an integrated management user interface, snapshots and enhanced scalability.

==Prominent Partners==
MapR's M3 and M5 editions have been selected Amazon as a premium options on the Elastic MapReduce service.  The only other option is Amazon's version of Hadoop 0.20.205.

Google has also partnered with MapR and highlighted MapR's capabilities in the launch of the Google Compute Engine.&lt;ref name=google-mapr&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Compute Engine Leverages Third Party Support |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/virtual/240003042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cisco has also announced support of MapR software on the UCS platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cisco UCS with MapR:  Delivering Advanced Performance  for Hadoop Workloads|url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns340/ns517/ns224/ns944/le_38203_sb_mapr_130208.pdf|publisher=Cisco|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
