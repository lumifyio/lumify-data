'''Ventis BackupSuite 2008''' is a collection of applications that together form a backup system. This system can back up files to external [[hard drive]]s, USB keys, local folders, network folders, [[CD]]/[[DVD]] media  and [[FTP]] folders. Data [[encryption]] and [[data compression|compression]] can be achieved by selecting backups to be archived as [[ZIP (file format)|Zip]] files. The three standard data repository models (full, differential and incremental) are supported. In addition to this, it is possible to make mirror backups. It is possible to search for backed up files and folders using [[wildcard characters]] ("*" and "?"). Another feature is that backup databases are handled like normal documents instead of having one central [[database]] (the vendor claims that it is safer to have many smaller databases than one big database containing all the backup information). The [[user interface]] resembles very much the user interface in [[Microsoft Office 2007]].

==System requirements==
[[.NET Framework 2.0]]&lt;br /&gt;
800 [[MHz]] [[CPU]] or more&lt;br /&gt;
512 [[Megabyte|MB]] [[Random access memory|RAM]]&lt;br /&gt;
200 [[Megabyte|MB]] free [[hard disk]] space

==Name==
The program's name is derived from the vendor's name VentisPro. Ventis is the plural of "venti", which means "twenty" in [[Italian language|Italian]]. The name "BackupSuite" comes from the fact that it is a [[software suite]] package consisting of several applications each performing various backup-oriented tasks.
