==Early life==
Alfred Lambourne was born to William and Martha Lambourne in England. The family emigrated to America when Alfred was a child.

==Art and exploration==
After arriving in [[Salt Lake City]], Lambourne took work as a scenic artist for the Salt Lake Theatre.&lt;ref name="The Alfred Lambourne Pages" /&gt;

Lambourne traveled the American West with photographer [[Charles Roscoe Savage]], painting as Savage photographed.&lt;ref name="The Alfred Lambourne Pages" /&gt;

Lambourne explored the [[Wasatch range]] with [[H. L. A. Culmer]], painting and naming features. He also visited [[Yosemite]], [[Colorado]] and [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name="The Alfred Lambourne Pages" /&gt;

Lambourne and [[Reuben Kirkham]] "painted a series of large canvasses representing his journey from the eastern coast of the United States, to the [[Golden Gate]]."&lt;ref name="The Alfred Lambourne Pages" /&gt;

He also accompanied [[Brigham Young]] to [[Zion Canyon]] and allegedly made the first paintings of the area.&lt;ref name="The Alfred Lambourne Pages" /&gt;

Later in life he focused more on writing, sometimes illustrating his work.
