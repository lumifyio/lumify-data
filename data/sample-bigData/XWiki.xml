'''XWiki''' is a [[free software|free]] [[wiki software]] platform written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] with a design emphasis on extensibility. XWiki Enterprise, the [[enterprise wiki]] edition, includes [[WYSIWYG]] editing, [[OpenDocument]] based document import/export, semantic annotations and tagging, and advanced permissions management.&lt;ref&gt;http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Features&lt;/ref&gt;

As an [[application wiki]], XWiki allows for the storing of structured data and the execution of server side script within the wiki interface. Scripting languages including [[Jakarta Velocity|Velocity]], [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[PHP]] can be written directly into wiki pages using wiki [[macro (computer science)|macros]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/DevGuide/Scripting Scripting Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; User created data structures can be defined in wiki documents and instances of those structures can be attached to wiki documents, stored in a database, and queried using either [[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]] query language or XWiki's own query language.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theserverside.com/news/1363830/XWiki-A-Platform-for-Collaborative-Apps&lt;/ref&gt;

XWiki.org's [http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ extension wiki] is home to XWiki extensions ranging from code [[Snippet (programming)|snippets]] which can be pasted into wiki pages to loadable core modules.&lt;ref&gt;http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/&lt;/ref&gt; Many of XWiki Enterprise's features are provided by extensions which are bundled with it.&lt;ref&gt;http://enterprise.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Features&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wikitext]] is rendered using the [http://rendering.xwiki.org/ XWiki Rendering Engine] which extends [http://code.google.com/p/wikimodel/ WikiModel] and [[Doxia]] systems, allowing it to parse [[Confluence (software)|Confluence]], JSPWiki, [[Creole (markup)|Creole]], [[MediaWiki]], and [[TWiki]] syntaxes as well as XWiki's own syntax.&lt;ref&gt;http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XWikiSyntax&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
XWiki code is licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] and hosted on [[GitHub]] where everyone is free to [[fork (software development)|fork]] the source code and develop changes in their own repository. The content included in the XWiki Enterprise wiki is licensed under a [[Creative Commons licenses#Attribution|Creative Commons attribution license]] so that it can be redistributed as long as it references XWiki; derivatives can be re-licensed entirely.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/License&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the active developers are funded by commercial support company XWiki [[Société par actions simplifiée|SAS]], XWiki SAS maintains a strict boundary between itself and the XWiki free software project.&lt;ref&gt;http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Governance&lt;/ref&gt; All decisions about the direction of the XWiki software project are made by [[consensus]] of the [[committers]] must go through the [http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/MailingLists developers' mailing list]&lt;ref&gt;http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/Committership&lt;/ref&gt;

XWiki uses [[Jenkins (software)]] for [[continuous integration]] http://ci.xwiki.org/ and [[JIRA]] as a bug (and feature request) tracker.&lt;ref&gt;http://jira.xwiki.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

XWiki was originally written by Ludovic Dubost who founded XPertNet [[Société à responsabilité limitée|SARL]] later to become XWiki SAS, and it was first released in January 2003 under the [[GNU General Public License]]. The first version of the Wiki Farm [http://www.xwiki.com xwiki.com] was released in April 2003.

In 2006, the license was changed to the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] to give the developer community greater flexibility,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/XWikiAvailableUnderLGPL&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apache Maven]] developer Vincent Massol became the lead developer&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/XPertNetSARLbecomesXWikiSAS&lt;/ref&gt; and XWiki won the Lutece d'Or award for best open source software developed for the enterprise.

After 6 beta versions and 5 release candidates, XWiki 1.0 was released on May 22, 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki10&lt;/ref&gt; bringing new features such as stand-alone installer and semantic tagging.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki10Beta1&lt;/ref&gt; 2007 also brought the introduction of [http://watch.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/ XWiki Watch] for allowing teams to collaboratively follow [[RSS]] feeds.

==Features==

* [[Structured wiki|Structured content]] and inline scripting, which allows building  [[wiki application]]s
* User rights management (by wiki / space / page, using groups, etc...)
* PDF export
* Full-text search
* Version control
* Import office documents into wiki syntax through OpenOffice
* Various protocols for accessing the wiki (WebDAV, REST, XmlRpc, GWT)
* Content and site design Export and Import
* Plugins, API, Programming...
* More features on the official website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/ Xwiki.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

XWiki is also an [[application wiki]] that allows the creation of [[Object (computer science)|objects]] and [[Class (computer science)|classes]] within the wiki. This way, [[Form (web)|forms]] can be developed in a very short time span and be reused to enter data on the wiki following a specific [[Page layout#Grids versus templates|template]]. This means that end users can be presented with a page on which the layout is already drawn, where they can directly fill in the fields needed.

== Open source projects ==

XWiki relies heavily on other open source projects to work. They include:

* [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]]: for advanced scripting requirements
* [[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]]: relational database storage
* [[Lucene]]: to index all the content of a wiki and its attachments and allow the search within their content.
* [[Jakarta Velocity|Velocity]]: a powerful template language
