===[[The New Naptilians]]===
This is a comic book written in his spare time by a schoolboy; it has no encyclop&amp;aelig;dic content. [[User:Mel Etitis|Mel Etitis]]  ([[User talk:Mel Etitis|&lt;font color="green"&gt;&amp;Mu;&amp;epsilon;&amp;lambda; &amp;Epsilon;&amp;tau;&amp;eta;&amp;tau;&amp;eta;&amp;sigmaf;&lt;/font&gt;)]] 10:15, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Do you reckon it's worth running a VFD on [[Geppers Creepers]] too?  [[User:The JPS|The JPS]] 11:22, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
**I did think of that; I'm something of a [[m:Mergism|mergist]]/[[m:Inclusionism|inclusionist]], though, so I'm inclined to give articles the benefit of the doubt if I can.  I couldn't bring myself to vote to keep it, though.

***'''Note:''' [[Geppers Creepers]] is now listed on VFD. [[User:The JPS|The JPS]] 23:15, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Nowhere near notable enough. [[User:Starblind|Andrew Lenahan - &lt;FONT COLOR="#FF0000"&gt;St&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR="#FF5500"&gt;ar&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR="#FF8000"&gt;bli&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR="#FFC000"&gt;nd&lt;/FONT&gt;]] 13:41, May 9, 2005 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. There seems to be a complete lack of influence or popularity to this one. [[User:Average Earthman|Average Earthman]] 19:16, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
*'''Delete''', not notable. [[User:Megan1967|Megan1967]] 01:54, 10 May 2005 (UTC)
