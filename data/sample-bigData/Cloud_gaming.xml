'''Cloud gaming''', sometimes called '''gaming on demand''', is a type of [[Online game|online gaming]]. Currently there are two main types of cloud gaming: cloud gaming based on ''video'' streaming and cloud gaming based on ''file'' streaming. Cloud gaming aims to provide end users friction-less and direct play-ability of games across various devices. 

==Types of cloud gaming==
Cloud gaming is an umbrella term used to describe a form of online game distribution. The most common methods of cloud gaming currently are video (or pixel) streaming and file streaming. 

=== Video streaming ===
'''Cloud gaming''', also called '''gaming on demand''', is a type of [[Online game|online gaming]] that allows direct and on-demand [[Stream (computing)|streaming]] of games onto computers, consoles and mobile devices, similar to [[video on demand]], through the use of a [[thin client]], in which the actual game is stored on the operator's or game company's [[Server (computing)|server]] and is streamed directly to computers accessing the server through the client. This allows access to games without the need of a [[Video game console|console]] and largely makes the [[Instructions per second|capability]] of the user's computer unimportant, as the server is the system that is running the processing needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hcc.techradar.com/playback/game_news/exclusive+does+cloud+gaming+spell+end+consoles+24+03+09 |title=Exclusive: Does cloud gaming spell the end for consoles? |author= |date=March 24, 2009 |work= |publisher=[[TechRadar]] |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Taking gaming into the 'cloud' |first= |last= |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=June 9, 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/8085937.stm |accessdate=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controls and button presses from the user are transmitted directly to the server, where they are recorded, and the server then sends back the game's response to the input controls.

Companies that use this type of cloud gaming include [[Gaikai]], [[Onlive|OnLive]] and [[Bigfish games|Big Fish Games]].

Gaming on demand is a game service which takes advantage of a broadband connection, large server clusters, [[encryption]] and [[Data compression|compression]] to stream game content to a subscriber's device. Users can play games without downloading or installing the actual game. Game content isn't stored on the user's hard drive and game code execution occurs primarily at the server cluster, so the subscriber can use a less powerful computer to play the game than the game would normally require, since the server does all performance-intensive operations usually done by the end user's computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=OnLive launches cloud-based gaming service |first=Claudine |last=Beaumont |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=June 18, 2010 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/7838692/OnLive-launches-cloud-based-gaming-service.html |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=OnLive launch cloud gaming platform |first=Joe |last=Crowther |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date=June 17, 2010 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/831469-onlive-launch-cloud-gaming-platform |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cloud gaming platforms are closed and proprietary; the first open source cloud gaming platform was not released until April, 2013. &lt;ref name="ga"&gt;{{cite news |title=GamingAnywhere -- An Open Source Cloud Gaming System |url=http://gaminganywhere.org |date=April 17, 2013 |accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== File streaming ===
Cloud gaming based on file streaming, also known as progressive downloading, deploys a thin client in which the actual game is run on the users gaming device such as a mobile, a PC or a console. This small part of a game, usually less than 5% of the total game size, is downloaded initially so that the gamer can start playing quickly. The remaining game content is [[Downloading|downloaded]] to the end user device while playing. This allows instant access to games with [[Bandwidth (computing)|low bandwidth]] Internet connections without lag. The cloud is used for providing a scalable way of [[Downloading|streaming]] the game content and [[Big data|big data analysis]].

Cloud gaming based on file streaming requires the device has the hardware capabilities to operate the game. Often, downloaded game content is stored on the end user's device where it is [[Cache (computing)|cashed]]. 

Companies that use this type of cloud gaming include [[Kalydo]], Approxy and SpawnApps.

On March 10, 2010, [[OnLive]] officially launched. The OnLive Game Service then turned on in the US on June 17, 2010, at an initial monthly service fee of $4.95, plus the cost of games and the OnLive [[microconsole]].&lt;ref name="LaunchAnnouncement"&gt;{{cite web|last=Perlman |first=Steve |url=http://blog.onlive.com/2010/03/10/onlive-coming-to-a-screen-near-you/ |title=OnLive: Coming to a Screen Near You |publisher=OnLive.com |date= 2010-03-10|accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCNewsArticle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8556874.stm |title='Console killer' OnLive to launch in June|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |date= 2010-03-11|accessdate=2010-03-11|first=Maggie|last=Shiels}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this fee was not to be applied for a year while OnLive worked out their business model and anyone who signed up during 2010 would not be charged until 2011 as well as have their account marked as a "founding member". Later, the fee was removed altogether as part of a review of this business model and as of October 2010, there are no plans to reintroduce this fee to simply use the service.

On February 27, 2011, [[Gaikai]], which allows game publishers and others to embed free streaming gameplay trials on their web sites, launched its open beta with games from [[Electronic Arts]] including [[Dead Space 2]], [[Mass Effect 2]], and [[Sims 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gaikai cloud gaming service goes live |date=February 27, 2011 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20036987-1.html |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaikai-enabled games can be embedded directly inside websites, on Facebook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/06/24/gaikai-to-add-10-million-monthly-active-users-by-fall-2011/|title=Gaikai to add 10 million monthly active users by fall 2011|date=June 24, 2011|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on mobile devices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/world-of-warcraft-running-on-an-ipad--172689.phtml|title=World of Warcraft running on an iPad?|author=Zimmerman, Conrad|date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and IPTVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/06/10/perry-promises-gaikai-on-tvs-by-2012/|title=Perry promises Gaikai on TVs by 2012|date=June 10, 2011|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 2011, Gaikai went live with multiple partnerships including [[Walmart]] and [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]], as well as announcing deals with [[Eurogamer]] and [[Capcom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2011/07/capcom-teams-up-with-cloud-video-game-company-gaikai/1?loc=interstitialskip|title=Capcom teams up with cloud video game company Gaikai|author=Snider,Mike|date=July 5, 2011|accessdate=July 5, 2011|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaikai-enabled games stream from within web browsers without requiring downloads, special plug-ins, or registration, and can be activated by clicking on an enabled advertisement or visiting a Gaikai-powered game destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaikai.com/about#general|title=What is Gaikai?|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2011, [[Ubitus]], a Taiwanese cloud computing company, launched [[G CLOUD]] service based on its product [[GameCloud]], on [[NTT docomo]] LTE commercial network with [[NHN Japan]] collaboration.

September 11, 2012 saw the launch of [[CiiNOW]], a new cloud gaming platform. CiiNOW claims to have pioneered a new approach called hybrid streaming. Hybrid streaming consists of streaming graphics primitives as well as video simultaneously. It utilizes some processing on a client to achieve better quality at lower bandwidth.&lt;ref name="CiiNOW's general availability announcement"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shereshevsky|first=Ilya|title=Consultant|url=http://ciinow.com|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2013 the first open source cloud gaming system, GamingAnywhere,&lt;ref name="ga" /&gt; was released.
