'''OpenKM''' is a [[free software|Free/Libre]] [[document management system]] that provides a web interface for managing arbitrary files. OpenKM includes a content repository, [[Lucene]] indexing, and [[jBPM]] workflow.  The OpenKM system was developed using [[Java platform|Java]] technology.

In 2005 two developers involved in open source technologies and expertise with some commercial document management solutions (Sharepoint, Documentum, Hummingbird, among others) like Excalibur search engine or Kofax OCR engine decided to start an open source project based on high level technologies to build a document management system that they decided to call OpenKM.

At the project's outset, it received the help of Spanish government funds from the [http://www.mityc.es/profitTIC/ PROFIT] project.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} At the end of 2006 the first OpenKM version was released.

== License ==
OpenKM uses the [[GNU General Public License]] (Version 2) license.

== Usage ==
OpenKM is a web-based document management application, so only a web browser is needed to use it. Currently only [[Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] are supported. The web interface is built using [[Google Web Toolkit]], so the browser support depends on the toolkit.

== Architecture ==
OpenKM is developed using Java technology based on Java EE standards and the JBoss application server. Therefore it can be installed and executed on various platforms ([[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], etc.)

The OpenKM architecture is based on the following technologies:

* [[JBoss]] Application Server
* [[Java (programming language)|Java]] EE (JDK 1.5 or higher)
* [[Apache Jackrabbit]]
* [[Google Web Toolkit|GWT]] (Google Web Toolkit - Ajax)
* [[Lucene]]

Due to its architecture, OpenKM can work on any operating system &amp;mdash; [[Unix]], [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] &amp;mdash; though [[Linux]] is recommended by the developers. Data can be stored in a directory or in any RDBMS ([[Oracle Database|Oracle]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[MySQL]], etc.)

== General features ==
A [[document management]] system manages personal documents or business documentation, making it easier to find a previous document version. It enables searching by content, using document content indexing. OpenKM supports several languages, currently [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[Euskera]], [[French language|French]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language| Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Turkish language|Turkish ]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].
