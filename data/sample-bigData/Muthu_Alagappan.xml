'''Muthu Alagappan''' (born c. 1990)&lt;ref name="Mercury News: cult status"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes 2012 30 Under 30: Sports"/&gt; is a medical student known for his [[National Basketball Association|professional basketball]] [[analytics]].

== Early life ==

Alagappan was born in [[Crewe, England]]&lt;ref name="Tamil Culture interview"/&gt; and raised in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name="Forbes 2012 30 Under 30: Sports"/&gt; He is of [[Indian people|Indian]] heritage.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; He graduated from [[Stanford University]] in 2012 with a degree in biomedical engineering.&lt;ref name="TEDx Spokane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; {{as of|2013}}, he is a medical student at [[Stanford School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="TEDx Spokane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; Alagappan is a longtime [[Houston Rockets]] fan.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2012 30 Under 30: Sports"/&gt;

== Basketball analytics ==

Alagappan was hired as an [[intern]] with [[Ayasdi]], a [[big data]] [[startup company|startup]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], through Stanford's [[Mayfield Fellows Program]], where he was hired to do sales.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; He tested the company's software on basketball stats and called the output "the true positions of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]".&lt;ref name="Mercury News: cult status"/&gt; The [[topological data analysis]] mapped similarities between NBA players and identified 13 distinct [[Basketball positions|positions of play]], as opposed to the traditional five.&lt;ref name="NYT: Trading Small Forward"/&gt; Those traditional positions, such as [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] and [[shooting guard]], have become ambiguous and outmoded as a result of the increased variety of player styles categorized by them.&lt;ref name="NYT: Trading Small Forward"/&gt; Alagappan's method groups professional basketball players by statistical strengths and places them into the new positional model.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2012 30 Under 30: Sports"/&gt;

He started with a collection of seven basic statistics ([[Assist (basketball)|assists]], [[Block (basketball)|blocks]], [[Assist (basketball)|fouls]], [[Point (basketball)|points]], [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], [[Steal (basketball)|steals]], and [[Turnover (basketball)|turnovers]]) from [[Yahoo! Sports]] on every NBA player from the previous season and adjusted the stats for time in play.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; The software grouped the players into color-coded nodes and connected them with lines that represented statistical similarities.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; Alagappan had expected the software to create five groups of nodes by statistical advantages, which would each represent a position of play, but the software instead returned 13 node groups representing 13 mathematically-described positions.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; The assignments compare player statistics and not individual style.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; Originally unconfident in his results, he explored the data on his own for a week before sharing his findings with his bosses and basketball statisticians including [[Ken Pomeroy]], who replied in encouragement.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; He then applied and was accepted to speak at the 2012 [[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference]].&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; By May 2012, at least four NBA teams and one [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] team had contacted Ayasdi about using their technology.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt;

The method is intended to change existing basketball team composition paradigms to help NBA teams win championships.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; Alagappan used [[Devin Ebanks]] of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] as an example, whom Alagappan considered promising for his classification as a "scoring rebounder" alongside [[Carmelo Anthony]] and [[Dirk Nowitzki]] despite a subpar season record.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; [[GQ]] reported that Ebanks would come to fulfill the model's forecast in following games for six weeks when two other players sat out and Ebanks [[Starting lineup#Basketball|started]] games.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt; While the model couldn't have predicted [[Linsanity]], when given college basketball stats, it was able to determine three players most similar to Lin in college, of which two were already drafted in the NBA.&lt;ref name="Wired: Analytics Reveal 13"/&gt; The forecasting is expected to improve with the growth of the data set.&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt;

His data-driven analysis has been well received. He won the top prize in the "Evolution of Sports" category at the 2012 [[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference]].&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercury News: cult status"/&gt; ''[[GQ]]'' called his work "a new frontier for the NBA" and "Muthuball", an allusion to [[Sabermetrics|Moneyball]], [[baseball]] [[statistical analysis]] known for revolutionizing the sport.&lt;ref name="Mercury News: cult status"/&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' included him in their 2012 "30 Under 30" list of influential people in the sports industry.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2012 30 Under 30: Sports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercury News: cult status"/&gt; His work has received mention in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[ESPN]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', and ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.&lt;ref name="Mercury News: cult status"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GQ: Muthuball"/&gt;

Rob Mahoney of [[The New York Times]] called the model "a novel execution of a productive thought", but cited the "one-of-a-kind" catch-all position and the substantial number of players categorized within it as weak points.&lt;ref name="NYT: Trading Small Forward"/&gt; [[ESPN]] [[TrueHoop]]'s Jim Calvan criticized Alagappan's Sloan presentation for its lack of data showing how team reconfiguration to cover the 13 positions results in more wins.&lt;ref name="ESPN TrueHoop: Solving"/&gt;
