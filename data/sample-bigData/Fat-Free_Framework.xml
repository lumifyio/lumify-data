The source code (~50KB) is written entirely in [[PHP]] and engineered specifically with user experience and usability as its primary design goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackoverflow.com/tags/fat-free-framework/info About Fat-Free Framework (from StackOverflow)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/php-fat-free-framework/Jason_Gilmore04052011.php3 Slim Down Your PHP Development]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ssokolow.com/archives/2011/11/13/my-impressions-of-fat-free-framework-for-php/ My Impressions of Fat-Free Framework for PHP]&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly called F3 by PHP developers, Fat-Free was released as free software in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phparch.com/2010/02/fat-free-a-new-php-framework/ php Architect Feb 26, 2010 issue]&lt;/ref&gt; Its general architecture was influenced by [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]'s [[Sinatra (software)|Sinatra]]. The lightweight code base&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codewalkers.com/c/a/PHP-Software-Reviews/Five-Great-PHP-Frameworks/ PHP Software Reviews: Five Great PHP Frameworks]&lt;/ref&gt; is controlled and actively maintained by a small core team, with additional functionality and funding contributions coming from various enterprises and user groups,&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/bcosca/fatfree#credits Credits]&lt;/ref&gt; who also help guide its future direction.

The base feature set includes a [[URL]] router, [[Cache (computing)|cache]] engine, and support for multilingual applications. Fat-Free also has a number of [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] that extend its functionality as well as [[Data mapper pattern|data mappers]] for [[SQL]] and [[NoSQL]] database [[back-end]]s: [[SQLite]], [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[MSSQL]], [[Sybase]], [[IBM DB2|DB2]], [[MongoDB]], [[CouchDB]], and [[Flat file database|Flat File]].
