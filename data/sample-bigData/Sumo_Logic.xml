'''Sumo Logic''' is a cloud-based [[log management]] and analytics service that leverages [[Big Data]] to deliver real-time IT insights, headquartered in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Cloud-Analytics-Startup-Sumo-Logic-Exits-Stealth-Raises-15M-574795/&lt;/ref&gt; Sumo Logic’s service provides timely and actionable information, gleaned from any type or source of log data, that not only helps solve operational, security and compliance challenges but provides critical business insights as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailydisruption.com/2012/02/disruptor-of-the-day-sumo-logic-harnessing-the-power-of-big-data-for-real-time-it/&lt;/ref&gt; Sumo Logic was founded in April 2010 by Kumar Saurabh and Christian Beedgen, and received funding from [[Accel Partners]], [[Greylock Partners]], [[Sutter Hill Ventures]] and angel investor Shlomo Kramer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/sumo-logic-raises-15m-series-b-round-next-generation-log-management-analytics-1612992.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The round of series C funding announced in November 2012 brings the company’s total venture capital backing to $50.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Sumo-Logic-Raises-30-Million-Series-C-Funding-Help-Enterprises-Drive-Actionable-1730970.htm/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
Sumo Logic’s architecture features an elastic petabyte scale platform that collects, manages and analyzes enterprise log data, reducing millions of log lines into valuable operational insights in real time.&lt;ref&gt;http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/31/log-data-management-and-analytics-startup-sumo-logic-raises-15m-from-greylock-and-others/&lt;/ref&gt; Their cloud-based approach overcomes the inherent problems of premise-based solutions, including limits on scalability, inefficient or haphazard analysis, and uncontrolled costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailydisruption.com/2012/02/disruptor-of-the-day-sumo-logic-harnessing-the-power-of-big-data-for-real-time-it/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netflix]], the world's leading Internet subscription service for enjoying movies and TV programs, determined after exhaustive testing that only Sumo Logic can scale to meet the company’s multi-terabyte Big Data volume requirements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sumologic.com/follow-us/press/2012-09-11-netflix-selects-sumo-logic-next-generation-log-management-and-analytics-service.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

Sumo Logic is built around a globally distributed data retention architecture that keeps all log data available for instant analysis, eliminating the need for an enterprise to manage the cost and complexity of data archiving, backups and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailydisruption.com/2012/02/disruptor-of-the-day-sumo-logic-harnessing-the-power-of-big-data-for-real-time-it/&lt;/ref&gt;

The service  is entirely cloud-based and is maintenance free.&lt;ref&gt;http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/31/sumo-logic-raises-15m-drops-its-stealthy-status/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumo Logic modeled its approach on that of [[Google]], according to Christian Beedgen, the company’s CTO and one of its Cofounders. Sumo Logic uses advanced machine learning algorithms to whittle down mountains of log file data into common groupings, much the way Google News categorizes new stories distributed across the web, making it easier for administrators to synthesize the information.&lt;ref&gt;http://servicesangle.com/blog/2012/01/31/sumo-logic-emerges-from-stealth-to-take-on-splunk-log-data-analytics/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Sumo Logic announced Sumo Logic Free, a [[freemium]] full functionality edition of its analytical solution that is deployed on [[Amazon Web Services]],&lt;ref&gt;http://siliconangle.com/blog/2012/06/26/sumo-logic-goes-freemium-with-data-analysis/&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 2012, the company announced Sumo Logic for VMware, which allows enterprises to search, visualize and analyze all [[VMware]] logs in real time so they can monitor and detect events within VMware virtual environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.talkincloud.com/sumo-logic-for-vmware-digs-deep-into-real-time-insights/&lt;/ref&gt;
