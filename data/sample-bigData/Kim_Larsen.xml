'''Kim Melius Flyvholm Larsen''' (born October 23, 1945 in [[Copenhagen]]) is a Danish [[rock music]]ian.

==Career==
Inspired by [[The Beatles]] and [[rock and roll]], Larsen began as a songwriter and [[guitarist]]. In 1969 he met [[Franz Beckerlee]] and [[Wili Jønsson]], and the three founded [[Gasolin']] which, later joined by drummer [[Søren Berlev]], became one of the most successful Danish rock bands.  The band dissolved in the late 1970s and has always refused to reform although they remain very popular decades after their 1970s heyday, which has contributed to their myth and magic. In 2006, the documentary movie ''Gasolin''' directed by Anders Østergaard, gave the history of the band and became a big hit in Denmark.

In the 1970s, following trends found in North America and the United Kingdom, Danish popular music styles began to diverge and audiences fragment. Many rock musicians in Denmark began to compose music and texts that reflected more realistic Danish social settings and ideals. Danish musicologist Charlotte Rørdam Larsen states that in the 1970s, Danish groups such as Kim Larsen's ''Gasolin''' gave Danish music a special Danish rhythm and significance, linguistically, if not wholly distinct musically from international styles.

Kim Larsen released a number of solo albums in the 1980s, topping in 1983 with the album ''Midt om natten'' (In the Middle of the Night), which became the most sold Danish music album in history, with more than 532,000 copies sold. The album ''Midt om natten'' more or less became a soundtrack for the movie by the same name based upon it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087720/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Larsen founded the band ''Kim Larsen &amp; Bellami'' and released four albums until 1992, when after a couple of different line-ups, the band broke up.  He then released another solo album, ''Hvem kan sige nej til en engel'' (Who Can Say No To An Angel). In 1995, Larsen moved to [[Odense]], the main city of the island of [[Funen]], and found new success with his new band, ''Kim Larsen &amp; Kjukken'' and the Swedish producer Max Lorentz.

Kim Larsen has had a number of successful album releases throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s (decade) and is possibly the most successful artist in Danish popular music history.  As a solo artist, Larsen has sold approximately 3 million records, a remarkable feat considering Denmark's total population of approximately 5.4 million people (as of 2005). In the 2000s (decade), Larsen remains a top concert draw and continues to be very popular in Denmark and elsewhere in Scandinavia.

==Protest singer==
Larsen has many times voiced his opposition to the established society and instead advocated the right to be different from the mainstream: The album and movie [[Midt om natten]] revolves around this subject - in fact you can compare the movie action to the real [[Freetown Christiania]], located in [[Copenhagen]]. The same opposition is also shown by the album [[231045-0637]] - the title is Kim Larsens social security number which is strictly personal. Larsen was against the big database of every citizen, implied by this title.

As a heavy smoker, he paid in August 2008 an advertising campaign which showed the text "Tillykke med rygeforbudet - Gesundheit macht frei !!!". The first sentence means "Congratulations on the smoking ban" in Danish, the second sentence means "health makes free" in German. Whilst smoking bans are allegedly not made to protect smokers, but non-smokers, Kim Larsen constructed a connection between smoking bans and such [[Nazism|Nazi]] phrases as [[Arbeit macht frei]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ekstrabladet.dk/flash/dkkendte/article1046636.ece&lt;/ref&gt;
