'''''De Hoop''''' (English: ''[[Hope|The Hope]]'') is a [[smock mill]] in [[Wachtum]], [[Drenthe]], which has been restored to working order. The mill was built in 1894 and is listed as a [[Rijksmonument]], number 11637.&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt;

==History==
''De Hoop'' was originally built at [[Veendam]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], where it was used as a drainage mill known as ''Hoop op Beter''. It was moved by [[millwright]] Rietsma of [[Haulerwijk]], [[Friesland]]. In 1937, streamlined leading edges were fitted to the sails although the mill stopped working c1940. The mill was restored in 1968-69 by millwright Huberts of [[Coevorden]] and returned to work with Herman Snijders as miller. Snijders died in 1997 and the ''Stichting Molen De Hoop'' (English: ''De Hoop Mill Society'') was set up to preserve the mill. A further restoration was undertaken in 2000 by millwright Molema of [[Heiligerlee]], Groningen. A new cap was fitted as well as longer sails and the mill was [[thatch|rethatched]].&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.molens.nl/dbase/molen.php?&amp;molenid=382 |title=Geschiedenis |publisher=De Hollandsche Molen |language=Dutch |accessdate=21 October 2009}} (Click on "Geschiedenis" to view.)&lt;/ref&gt; The restored mill was officially opened on 26 August 2000 (the [[National Mills Day|''Drentse Molendag'']]) by Mrs Kools, the Deputy Minister for Culture in Drenthe.&lt;ref name=Data&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.molendatabase.nl/nederland/molen.php?nummer=32 |title=Wachtum, Drenthe  |publisher=Molendatabase |language=Dutch |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{For|an explanation of the various items of machinery|Mill machinery}}
''De Hoop'' is what the Dutch describe as an "achtkante stellingmolen". It is a three-storey smock mill with a stage on a two-storey brick base. The stage is at first-floor level, {{convert|3.20|m|ftin}} above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Common sails have a span of {{convert|21.20|m|ftin}} and are carried in a cast-iron ''windshaft''. The ''windshaft'' also carries the ''brake wheel'' which has 71 cogs. This drives the ''wallower'' (38 cogs) at the top of the ''upright shaft''. At the bottom of the ''upright shaft'', the ''great spur wheel'', which has 97 cogs, drives the {{convert|1.30|m|ftin}} diameter French Burr stones via a ''lantern pinion stone nut'' with 28 staves. The mill formerly drove three pairs of millstones.&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.molens.nl/dbase/molen.php?&amp;molenid=382 |title=Technische gegevens |publisher=[[De Hollandsche Molen]] |language=Dutch |accessdate=21 October 2009}} (Click on "Technische gegevens" to view.)&lt;/ref&gt;
