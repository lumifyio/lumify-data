'''Cloudera Inc.''' is a [[Palo Alto]]-based American enterprise software company that provides [[Apache Hadoop]]-based software, support and services, and training to data driven enterprises.

Cloudera's open-source Apache Hadoop distribution, CDH (Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop), targets enterprise-class deployments of that technology. Cloudera says that more than 50% of its engineering output is donated upstream to the various Apache-licensed open source projects (Apache Hive, Apache Avro, Apache HBase, and so on) that combine to form the Hadoop platform. Cloudera is also a sponsor of the [[Apache Software Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Apache Software Foundation Sponsorship"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html|title=Apache Software Foundation Sponsorship|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred [[demonym]] for an employee of Cloudera is "Clouderan."&lt;ref name="Use of the term Clouderan to refer to an employee of Cloudera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/12/how-to-contribute-to-apache-hadoop-projects-in-24-minutes/|title=Use of the term Clouderan to refer to an employee of Cloudera|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and investors ==

The launch of Cloudera was announced by ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/bottling-the-magic-behind-google-and-facebook/|title=Bottling the Magic Behind Google and Facebook|last=Vance|first=Ashlee|date=16 March 2010|accessdate=22 April 2010 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; which called Cloudera "the quintessential Silicon Valley story". That article's author explained how three top engineers from [[Google]], [[Yahoo]] and [[Facebook Inc.|Facebook]] ([[Christophe Bisciglia]], Amr Awadallah and Jeff Hammerbacher, respectively) had joined with a former [[Oracle]] executive (Mike Olson) to "tackle the problems inherent in quickly analyzing big piles of data." 

In March 2009, Cloudera announced the availability of Cloudera Distribution Including [[Apache Software Foundation|Apache]] [[Hadoop]] in conjunction with a $5-million capital injection led by [[Accel Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/16/cloudera-raises-5-million-series-a-round-for-hadoop-commercialization/|title=Cloudera Raises $5 Million Series A Round For Hadoop Commercialization|last=Wauters |first=Robin|date=16 March 2010|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the company raised a further $40 million from [[Ignition Partners]], [[Accel Partners]], [[Greylock Partners]], [[Meritech Capital Partners]], and [[In-Q-Tel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venturebeat.com/2011/11/07/hadoop-cloudera-funding-ignition-accel-greylock/|title=Hadoop-based startup Cloudera raises $40M from Ignition Partners, Accel, Greylock|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

Cloudera offers software, services and support in three different bundles:
* Cloudera Enterprise - includes CDH and an annual subscription license (per node) to Cloudera Manager and technical support
* Cloudera Enterprise Free - includes CDH and Cloudera Manager Free Edition (CM Free Edition somewhat limited functionality)
* CDH may also be downloaded from Cloudera's website at no charge, but with no technical support nor Cloudera Manager

CDH contains the main, core elements of Hadoop that provide reliable, scalable distributed data processing of large data sets (chiefly MapReduce and HDFS), as well as other enterprise-oriented components that provide security, high availability, and integration with hardware and other software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/software/information-management/cloudera-releases-next-generation-hadoop/240001574/|title=Cloudera Releases Next-Generation Hadoop Platform|last=Henschen |first=Doug|date=6 June 2012|publisher=InformationWeek|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oct. 2012, Cloudera announced the Impala project, an open-source distributed query engine for Apache Hadoop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/clouderas-impala-brings-hadoop-to-sql-and-bi-7000006413/|title=Clouderaâ€™s Impala brings Hadoop to SQL and BI|last=Brust |first=Andrew|date=6 October 25, 2012|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
