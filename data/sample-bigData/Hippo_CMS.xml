'''Hippo CMS''' brings real-time relevance to their audience and is the foundation for personalized communication across all channels: mobile, social and web. Hippo [[Content Management System]] is [[Open Source|open-source]], 100% Java and convinces with its lean product architecture that is built for uptime, security and performance.

The Hippo CMS project was initiated by [http://www.onehippo.com/ Hippo]. It's targeted at medium to large organisations managing content for multi-channel distribution like web sites, mobile, tablet, facebook, extranets and intranets. It follows open standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onehippo.org/ Hippo Community Site, Overview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
The Hippo product suite or '''Hippo CMS''' ([[Enterprise Content Management]]) comprises a collection of components which by means of separation of concerns maximizes extensibility, interoperability and scalability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onehippo.org/about/architecture.html Architecture, The components of the Hippo Suite.]&lt;/ref&gt; The components available include:

| [[Image:Hippo-repository-icon.png|48px]]
| '''Hippo Repository'''
| The central component that stores content and provides content management and administration functionality. Content and functionality are exposed by [[Content repository API for Java|Content repository API for Java, JSR-170]] and are implemented on the reference implementation [[Apache Jackrabbit]].
| Hippo Site Toolkit and Hippo Portal
|-
| [[Image:Hippo-site-toolkit-icon.png|48px]]
| '''Hippo Site Toolkit'''
| This component provides the tools for rapid development of websites and a [[Representational state transfer|REST API]]. A templating engine is offered that can be controlled from Hippo CMS. Furthermore, a tag library and expression language offer development of a [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]] or [[FreeMarker]] based view layer.

== Open Source and Open Standards ==
Hippo CMS is user friendly, has an [[open architecture]] and is designed for interoperability with existing environments. Hippo CMS is built to integrate external sources of content into one. Therefore, it uses all relevant open standards to allow this integration. For many existing sources, connectors are available in the codebase.

The open architecture of Hippo CMS has the following key points:
* Faceted repository
* Open source
* [[Content repository API for Java|Content repository API for Java, JSR-170]]
* Works with open standards
* Reuse of content
* Separation of content, design, logic and the CMS itself.
* User friendly user interface
* Native XML, 100% Java
* No vendor lock-in

== Open source projects ==
{{Portal|Free software}}
Hippo CMS is based on several open source projects, mainly the following from the [[Apache Software Foundation]]:
* [[Apache Wicket|Wicket]]
* [[Apache Jackrabbit|Jackrabbit]]
* [[Apache Webserver]]
* [[Apache Solr|Solr]]
* [[Lucene]]
* [[Apache Maven|Maven]]
* [[Xerces]]
* [[Xalan]]
* [[Formatting Objects Processor|FOP]]
