&lt;h2 style="margin-right:60px;"&gt;Search function modified&lt;/h2&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;By [[User:Michael Snow|Michael Snow]], [[14 November]] [[2005]]&lt;/small&gt;
The search capability on Wikipedia was modified by the [[m:developers|developers]] last week as they work to improve performance and the quality of results.

On Monday, Chief Technical Officer [[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion Vibber]] [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2005-November/032344.html announced] that he had changed the way the [[Wikipedia:searching|searching]] function works.
In conjunction with [[MediaWiki]] software, Wikipedia uses a full-text search based on a [[Lucene]] core.

The change made affects searches that include more than one term, as results will now only show matches that contain all terms given. As Vibber explained, "This gives more focused results and is more consistent with typical search engine practice, and our behavior under the old MySQL search." In order to make a term optional, one should now use an OR operator (which must be capitalized). The use of [[Boolean logic]] remains available to construct searches generally.

The developers also responded to a complaint from [[User:Phil Boswell|Phil Boswell]] that the search function was producing errors. [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] explained that the servers were occasionally hanging, necessitating periodic restarts of the [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]]. Errors can also result from heavy server loads.

The search function is now supported by three servers, and configured to try the other two if one doesn't respond. This will hopefully reduce the amount of time for which internal searching is unavailable. For situations in which all three servers fail, a form showing the [[Google]] and [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]] search options will remain in place.
