      <text xml:space="preserve">'''MiTAP''', or Mitre Text and Audio Processing, is a computer system that tries to automatically gather, translate, organize, and present information "for monitoring infectious disease outbreaks and other global events." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Damianos et al, AI Magazine, Vol 23, No 4&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in the FBI [[Investigative Data Warehouse]].

'''Sources'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Multiple information sources in multiple languages are automatically captured, filtered, translated, summarized, and categorized''"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It uses 'web sources, electronic mailing lists, newsgroups, news feeds, and audio-video data.'. The audio-video is automatically transcribed into text by the [[ViTAP]] system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 

'''Guts'''

In 2002 it was reported to have used CyberTrans, the Alembic natural language analyzer, WebSumm summarizer, Lucene indexing, NewsBlaster from Columbia, Brill tagging, SOAP, HTML, NNTP, Perl, Unix scripts, and other tools. Upgrades to various components are planned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Damianos et al, AAAI Proceedings, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creators'''

It was created at the [[Mitre Corporation]] by Damianos and a team of other researchers, with public release in 2001.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damianos et al, ''The MiTAP System...'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Users'''

It is being used by the FBI as part of their [[Investigative Data Warehouse]] via [[DARPA TIDES program|DARPA's TIDES program]].&lt;ref&gt;FBI, ''IDW System Security Plan'', 2003, and ''Security Concept of Operations IDW'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2004 FBI email, MiTAP was running at [[San Diego State University]], collecting only English language website news. It mentioned a plan to have FBI run its own version of MiTAP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eff.org/files/filenode/foia_idw/20080408_idw02.pdf EFF FOIA file, 2008 Apr 8, idw02]. page 30 of linked pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been used by people in the [[Whitehouse]], the [[Department of Homeland Security]], the Pentagon,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the American Red Cross, the United Nations, and the European Disaster Center &lt;ref&gt;Damianos et al. AI Magazine, Vol 23, No 4&lt;/ref&gt;
