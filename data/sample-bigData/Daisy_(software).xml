'''Daisy''' is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]]/[[XML]] [[open-source]] [[content management system]] based on the [[Apache Cocoon]] [[content management framework]].  Today, Daisy is in use at major corporations for [[intranet]] [[knowledge base]]s, product and/or project [[documentation]], and management of content-rich websites.

== Content management system ==
The content is stored in so-called Daisy documents. These documents are managed by the Daisy Repository Server. Documents consist of parts. Parts can be anything from required blocks of [[Plain text|text]] to specified fields with restricted content. By creating specific document types, different types of information can be handled differently. Simple documents just hold text and [[hyperlink]]s. By including a [[Information retrieval|query]] in a document it is easy to create documents that aggregate other documents.

Each document can have multiple variants. A variant can be a version or a translated document ([[Language#Human languages|language]] variant). Variants can be used to mark specific versions, e.g. all documents referring to version XYZ of the software described.

Editing of Daisy documents is supported with a [[WYSIWYG]] [[Wiki]]-like editing environment.

Site navigation trees can be made more dynamic using queries generating navigation hierarchies.

Daisy is hierarchy-free and has a clear separation between [[wikt:repository|repository]] server and [[front-end]] application. This allows for easy extension of the functionality.

Other features are:
* [[revision control]]
* centralized [[Access control list|ACL]] system
* [[Lucene|Jakarta Lucene based full-text indexing]]
* [[book]] publishing which allows for the generation of nicely formatted books with [[table of contents]], section numbering, [[Cross-reference|cross-referencing]], [[Foot note|footnotes]] and [[Index (publishing)|index]]
* [[Faceted navigation|faceted browsing]]
* The Daisy 2.0 version added [[JBoss (company)|JBoss]] [[jBPM]]-based [[workflow]]

== Requirements ==
The packaged versions of Daisy 2.2 includes everything required to run Daisy, except for:
* a [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM): Java 1.5 or higher required
* a [[MySQL]] database: version 4.1.7 or higher required (5 also fine)

Daisy can potentially work with other databases, such as [[PostgreSQL]], but only MySQL is presently supported.

Daisy is thoroughly tested on [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows NT/2000/XP]], but should also run on other Unix operating systems such as [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cocoondev.org/daisydocs-2_2/13-cd.html Daisy 2.2 installation guide]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Daisy displays properly in most major browsers: [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Mozilla Application Suite|Mozilla]]/[[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]] with fallback to a text area on other browsers.

== Outerthought ==
Outerthought is an Open Source Java &amp; XML company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://outerthought.org|title=Outerthought|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outerthought supports Daisy and provides support to its community of users&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocoondev.org/daisy/45.html|title=Getting involved|accessdate=2008-08-22}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributors.

== Documentation ==
The documentation for Daisy runs on Daisy itself, and can be viewed online as [[HTML]] or downloaded in [[PDF]] as a "Daisy book".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daisycms.org/daisydocs-2_3 Daisy 2.3 Documentation]&lt;/ref&gt;
