'''Peter Baumann''' (born 1960 in [[Rosenheim]]) is a [[Germans|German]] computer scientist and professor at [[Jacobs University Bremen|Jacobs University]], [[Bremen]], [[Germany]], where he is head of the [http://www.jacobs-university.de/lsis Large-Scale Scientific Information Systems] research group in the [https://www.jacobs-university.de/case Center for Advanced Systems Engineering] (CASE).

==Academic positions==

Baumann is professor of [[Computer Science]] at [[Jacobs University Bremen|Jacobs University]], [[Bremen]], [[Germany]] and founder and CEO of [http://www.rasdaman.com rasdaman GmbH].

He is inventor and Princial Architect of the [[rasdaman]] [[Array DBMS]], the historically first complete implementation of what today is called a "Big Data Analytics" server for large, multi-dimensional [[Array data type|arrays]].
He has authored and co-authored 100+ book chapters and papers on [[array data structure|array]] (aka raster) databases and further fields, and has given tutorials on raster databases worldwide.

Baumann is active in many bodies concerned with scientific data access:
* member, [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC); functions:
** chair, Coverages Domain Working Group
** chair, Web Coverage Service Standards Working Group (WCS.SWG)
** chair, Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) Working Group (this group has been merged into the WCS.SWG)
** editor of the specifications making up the OGC [[Web Coverage Service]] (WCS) standards suite
* founding member and secretary, [http://www.codata-germany.org CODATA Germany]
* member, advisory board, GDI-HB (geo data infrastructure for Bremen)
* member, [http://www.cgi-iugs.org Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information], a Commission of the [http://www.iugs.org/ International Union of Geological Sciences]
* representative of [[Jacobs University Bremen]] in [http://www.gin-online.de/ Kompetenzzentrum Geoinformatik Niedersachsen ]

==Academic career==

Baumann obtained a degree in [[Computer Science]] (1987) from [[Technical University of Munich]], a doctorate (1993) in [[Computer Science]] at [[Darmstadt University of Technology]] while working with [[Fraunhofer Institute]] for Computer Graphics.
He has pursued post-doctoral activities in both industry and academia,
working for Softlab Group in Munich (now [[Cirquent]])
and as Assistant Head of the Knowledge Bases Research Group of [http://www.forwiss.de/index_en.html FORWISS] (Bavarian Research Center for Knowledge-based Systems) / [[Technical University of Munich]] where he was deputy to Prof. [[Rudolph Bayer]], Ph.D.
Among Dr. Peter Baumann's entrepreneurial acitivites was founding of the spin-off company [http://www.rasdaman.com rasdaman GmbH] for commercialization of the world's first multi-dimensional [[array data structure|array]] [[database system]].
In August 2004 he was appointed as Professor of Computer Science at [[Jacobs University Bremen]] (formerly: International University Bremen).

==Awards and patents==
* [http://www.it-prize.org European IT Prize] 1998
* [http://www.jsmf.be Jos Schepens Memorial Award] 1998
* Innovation Prize of the Bavarian State Government 1998
* [http://www.vdivde-it.de Founders Competition Multimedia] 1998

Baumann holds international patents on array databases.

==Research interests==

Baumann's current research interests include scalable [[database]] and [[Web service]] support for large, multi-dimensional [[Array data structure|arrays]], including [[algebraic modeling]], [[query language]], [[query optimization]], [[system architecture]], and applications such as [[earth sciences]] and [[life sciences]]. As part of this research, [[standardization]] of geo raster services is being addressed. As such, it is related to [[Dimensional databases]], however with a distinct focus on spatio-temporal, multi-dimensional [[raster graphics]] data, rather than business data.

Much of his concrete work is implemented and benchmarked in the framework of the [[rasdaman]] array DBMS.
