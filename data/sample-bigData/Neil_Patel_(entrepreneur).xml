===Advantage Consulting Services (ACS)===
In 2002 Patel co-founded ACS, an online [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) and marketing company, with business partner [[Hiten Shah]].&lt;ref name=newdirection&gt;{{cite web|last=Tiffany|first=Laura|title=A New Direction|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/183044|publisher=Entrepreneur|date=September 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, the company was doing more than $2.5 million a year in sales.&lt;ref name=newdirection/&gt; Patel and ACS would continue on to consult a variety of Fortune 500 companies including [[Hewlett Packard]], [[Samsung]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Microsoft]], [[AOL]], [[Walmart]], [[General Motors]], and [[Viacom]].&lt;ref name=mo/&gt;&lt;ref name=blogtalk/&gt;&lt;ref name=ss&gt;{{cite web|last=Kumar Saha|first=Mousumi|title=Success Story of Neil Patel, Co-founder of two Successful Startups Crazy Egg and KISSmetrics|publisher=Success Stories|date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yec&gt;{{cite web|title=Author Bio: Neil Patel|url=http://youngentrepreneurcouncil.com/author/neilp/|publisher=Young Entrepreneur Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crazy Egg===
In 2006, Patel and Shah founded Crazy Egg, a company which helps individuals and businesses determine what visitors are doing when they visit their site.&lt;ref name=cegg&gt;{{cite web|last=Cubrilovic|first=Nik|title=See What Your Website Visitors Are Doing With Crazy Egg|url=http://techcrunch.com/2006/03/13/see-what-your-website-visitors-are-doing-with-crazy-egg/|publisher=TechCrunch|date=March 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information is displayed in "heatmaps", showing where visitors clicked while on the site, a more visual method than the traditional analytics programs available at the time.&lt;ref name=crazy&gt;{{cite web|last=Townes|first=Frederick|title=Crazy Egg is Crazy Delicious!|url=http://mashable.com/2006/03/10/crazy-egg-is-crazy-delicious/|publisher=Mashable|date=March 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after launch, Patel reportedly had a $5 million offer to sell Crazy Egg, yet declined, saying he felt the company would sell for at least $10 million.&lt;ref name=mixergy&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Andrew|title=CrazyEgg: The Slow-Build Bootstrap – with Neil Patel|url=http://mixergy.com/crazyegg-neil-patel-interview/|publisher=Mixergy|date=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===KISSmetrics===
In 2008 Patel co-founded KISSmetrics, a customer analytics platform designed for small and mid-sized companies, again with business partner Hiten Shah.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=vb&gt;{{cite web|last=Koetsier|first=John|title=Neil Patel’s 10 tips on using metrics to make money|url=http://venturebeat.com/2012/08/23/neil-patel-likes-to-make-money-heres-how-he-does-it/|publisher=Venture Beat|date=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patel describes KISSmetrics as Crazy Egg 2.0--the service shows who visited, their actions, and how companies can use that information to improve sales and customer experience by tracking the lifelong value of the customer.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=kisssm&gt;{{cite web|last=Kincaid|first=Jason|title=KISSmetrics Helps You Hone In On Stats That Actually Matter With Cohort Reports|url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/23/kissmetrics-helps-you-hone-in-on-stats-that-actually-matter-with-cohort-reports/|publisher=TechCrunch|date=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company closed a $1 million [[seed round]] led by True Ventures in 2008. In mid-2009 it closed a $3 million round led by [[Polaris Ventures]], and has also secured angel investments from [[Dave McClure]], [[Bobby Yazdani]], and [[Nils Johnson]].&lt;ref name=tcfund&gt;{{cite web|last=Kincaid|first=Jason|title=KISSmetrics: A Conversion Funnel Tool That Gives Your Site A Memory|url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/22/kissmetrics-conversion-funnel/|publisher=TechCrunch|date=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patel's advisors at KissMetrics include [[Eric Ries]], [[Sean Ellis]], Jeff Veen, Jeff Hammerbacher, and Ed Baker.&lt;ref name=tcfund/&gt;

Since its launch in May 2008, the company has signed on more than 1,900 paying customers and has tracked more than 4.5 billion people and their 36 billion interactions.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;
