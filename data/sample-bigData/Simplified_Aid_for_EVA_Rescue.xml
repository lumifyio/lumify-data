'''Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue''' ('''SAFER''') is a small, self-contained, propulsive backpack system ([[jet pack]]) used to provide free-flying mobility for a [[Space Shuttle]] or [[International Space Station]] (ISS) crewmember during [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA).&lt;ref name="day8-92"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-92/sts-92-day-08-highlights.html|title=STS-92 Day 8 Highlights|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2000|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Flying Astronaut Over Earth"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sai.msu.su/apod/ap011002.html|title=Astronomy Picture of the Day A Flying Astronaut Over Earth  |accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2001|author=APOD}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFER is a small, simplified version of the [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]] (MMU) intended for contingency use during spacewalks.&lt;ref name="assembly"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption.jsp?searchpage=true&amp;keywords=SAFER&amp;textsearch=Go&amp;hitsperpage=5&amp;pageno=3&amp;photoId=S93-50137|title=SAFER Assembly|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=1993|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
SAFER is designed to be used as a self-rescue device for a separated EVA crewmember in situations when no vehicles can provide rescue capability.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E5D61F38F933A2575AC0A962958260|title=Shuttle Soars Into Orbit to Test Device for Space Rescues |accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|year=1994|author=Broad, William J. | date=September 10, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFER is worn by every ISS crewmember using an [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]]. SAFER was sponsored by the Space Shuttle Program. Ralph Anderson served as Project Manager for the Flight Test SAFER, Matt Leonard served as the Project Manager for the production versions and Cliff Hess was the Project Engineer.  The device was developed by the Robotics Division (with its contractor staff) of [[NASA]] at the [[Johnson Space Center]].  The SAFER was the design solution to the Shuttle Program's requirement to provide a means of self rescue should an EVA crewmember become untethered during an EVA.  

SAFER was first flown on [[STS-64]] September 9, 1994, where an untethered flight test was performed first by astronaut Mark Lee and then Carl Meade.  Both astronauts flew the SAFER up and around the Shuttle's Robotic Arm along with a demonstration test of the SAFER's automatic attitude hold feature.  This feature arrests uncontrolled rotationNeeded of a detached crewmember expected in an accidental separation.  SAFER has a mass of approximately 83 lb (38 kg) and can provide a total change in velocity ([[delta-v]]) of at least 10 ft/s (3 m/s).&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; It was also tested during flight [[STS-92]] when astronauts [[Peter J.K. Wisoff|Wisoff]] and [[Michael E. Lopez-Alegria|Lopez-Alegria]] performed test maneuvers, flying up to 50 feet while remaining tethered to the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-92/news/sts-92-mcc-15.txt STS-92 NASA Mission Report #15] NASA, 2008-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==

The left side latch on the SAFER unit became unlatched during an EVA by astronaut [[Piers Sellers]] on [[STS-121]] while testing shuttle repair techniques.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13815044/|title=Duct tape suggested for spacewalk repair|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|year=2006|author=Mike Schneider for the Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drama"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn9524-high-drama-spacewalk-ends-in-success.html|title=High drama spacewalk ends in success|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=New Scientist|year=2006|author=Kelly Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latch had been inadvertently bumped and moved to the unlatch position.  As a precaution, [[Mike Fossum]] tethered it to him and the spacewalk continued.&lt;ref name="spacecom"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/060712_sts121_eva3.html|title=Spacewalkers Test Shuttle Heat Shield Repair Technique |accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=Space.com|year=2006|author=Tariq Malik}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent spacewalks, the latches were secured with [[Kapton]] tape, a space-rated form of [[adhesive tape]], to prevent the latches from inadvertently opening. A hard cover is being designed for future missions.
