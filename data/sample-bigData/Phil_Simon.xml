=== Awards ===

== Views ==
Simon believes that the platform represents a fundamentally new business model—the most important one of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of the Platform|url=http://www.theageoftheplatform.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, [[API]]s and [[Software development kit|SDKs]] are enabling developers to build [[mobile app]]s and web services faster and on a much greater scale than ever. The most successful companies of the day—e.g., [[Amazon.com]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Facebook]], and [[Google]]—no longer focus on one line of business. Rather, they quickly and frequently add adjacent offerings, products, and services—i.e., ''planks.''

Through increasingly powerful ecosystems, companies today are externalizing a great deal of their innovation and evolving at rapid speeds. What's more, emerging platforms like [[Twitter]], [[Kickstarter]], Force.com, [[WordPress]], [[Udemy]], and scores of others are redefining business in tectonic ways that we have only begun to understand.

Simon's belief in the power of platforms is supported by the extensive economic research of people like [[Marshall Van Alstyne]].
