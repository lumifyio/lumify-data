'''OrientDB''' is an open source [[NoSQL]] [[database management system]] written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Even if it is a document-based database, the relationships are managed as in graph databases with direct connections between records. It supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes. It has a strong security profiling system based on users and roles and supports [[SQL]] as a query language. OrientDB uses a new indexing algorithm called MVRB-Tree, derived from the [[Red-Black Tree]] and from the [[B+Tree]]; this reportedly has benefits of having both fast insertions and fast lookups.

== Features ==
* Transactional: supports [[ACID]] [http://code.google.com/p/orient/wiki/Transactions Transactions]. On crash it recovers pending documents.
* GraphDB: native management of graphs. 100% compliant with [http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com TinkerPop Blueprints] standard for [[Graph database]].
* [[SQL]]: supports [http://code.google.com/p/orient/wiki/SQL SQL language] with extensions to handle relationships without [[SQL join]], manage trees and graphs of connected documents
* Web ready: supports natively [[HTTP]], [[RESTful]] protocol and [[JSON]] without use 3rd party libraries and components.
* Run everywhere: the engine is 100% pure [[Java (programming language)|Java]]: runs on Linux, Windows and any system that supports Java technology.
* Embeddable: local mode to use the database bypassing the Server. Perfect for scenarios where the database is embedded.
* [[Apache 2 License]]: always free for any usage. No fees or royalties required to use it.
* Light: has a footprint of about 1Mb for the full server. No dependencies from other software. No other libraries needed.
* Commercial support available.
