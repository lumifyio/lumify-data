'''Univa''' is a privately held software company that sells data center optimization software products.

== Products ==
Within its portfolio Univa develops, sells and supports [[Univa Grid Engine]], Univa's version of the popular workload and distributed resource management technology [[Grid Engine]]. Univa had announced in Jan 2011 that it has hired the key personnel formerly working for [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Sun Microsystems]] on Grid Engine development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univa.com/about/news/press_2011/01172011.php|public=Univa|date=Jan 17, 2011|title=Univa Acquires Grid Engine Expertise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Univa provides add-on products, solutions and technologies to Univa Grid Engine, such as 

* UniCloud&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univa.com/products/unicloud.php|public=Univa|title=About UniCloud}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; Dynamically optimizes resource utilization by ensuring applications are matched to the optimal data center resources. A feature of UniCloud extends internal computing environments (e.g. a Univa Grid Engine cluster) into an external (or "public") cloud service such as [[Amazon EC2]].
* Univa License Orchestrator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univa.com/products/license-orchestrator.php|public=Univa|title=Univa License Orchestrator}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; Enables applications to attain policy based and well managed access to software license keys and tokens when running in one or multiple Univa Grid Engine clusters.
* Univa Grid Engine for Hadoop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univa.com/solutions/big-data.php|public=Univa|title=Big Data Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; Integrates the popular [[Big Data]] technology [[Hadoop]] into Univa Grid Engine and thereby allows multi-tenant Hadoop applications to run concurrently without conflict and under policy and accounting control as well sharing the cluster resource across Hadoop and non-Hadoop workloads.
* UniSight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univa.com/products/unisight.php|public=Univa|title=About UniSight}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; Provides accounting, reporting and data analytics on top of the Univa Grid Engine and Grid MP (see below) accounting data.
* One Click HPC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univa.com/products/one-click-hpc.php|public=Univa|title=Grid Engine On Demand - Powered by RightScale}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; A [[cloud computing]] service providing fast, pay-as-you-go access to computing resources hosted on public clouds and managed via UniCloud and Univa Grid Engine.

Furthermore Univa offers [[Grid MP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univa.com/products/grid-mp.php|public=Univa|title=Grid MP Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; a product for building distributed computing environments from non-dedicated resources to deliver increased computing power (so called [[cycle stealing]]).

==Consulting services==
Univa offers consulting services for installation, tuning and configuration of its products.

== History ==
Univa was founded in 2004 under the name '''Univa Corporation''' by [[Carl Kesselman]], [[Ian Foster]], and [[Steve Tuecke]] and was at that time primarily known for providing [[open source]] products and technical support based around the [[Globus Toolkit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gridtoday.com/grid/1691219.html|public=Grid Today|date=July 30, 2007|title=Sun, Univa Give Partnership a Boost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gridtoday.com/grid/459538.html Univa Closes $8M Series-A Investment Round&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2007, the company announced that it would merge with the Austin, Texas-based [[United Devices]] and operate under the new name '''Univa UD'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterpriseitplanet.com/networking/news/article.php/3700406|title=United Devices, Univa to Merge|first=Paul|last=Shread|date=September 19, 2007|publisher=Enterprise IT Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company operated as Univa UD until formally dropping "UD" and returning to common use of Univa Corporation. Under the leadership of its current CEO Gary Tyreman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpcinthecloud.com/hpccloud/2010-07-08/roadmap_chat_with_univa_s_new_ceo_gary_tyreman.html|public=HPC in the Cloud|date=July 8, 2010|title=Roadmap Chat with Univaâ€™s New CEO, Gary Tyreman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Univa announced, January 17, 2011, that it had hired the principal and founding engineers of the Grid Engine team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univa.com/about/news/press_2011/01172011.php|public=Univa|date=Jan 17, 2011|title=Univa Acquires Grid Engine Expertise}}&lt;/ref&gt;
