'''Pervasive PSQL''' is an [[ACID]]-compliant [[DBMS]]&lt;ref name="Weijers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Transactions, Locking and DataFlex|url=http://www.dataaccess.com/whitepapers/TransactionsLockingandDataFlex.htm#DFCKPSQL|publisher=Data Access Worldwide|author=Wiejers, Ben|date=December, 2000 (updated October 2001)}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[Pervasive Software]]. It is optimized for [[embedded database|embedding]] in applications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delivering Embedded Database Solutions for Small and Medium-sized Businesses|url=http://www.pervasivedb.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/WP0907F_Hurwitz.pdf|publisher=Hurwitz and Associates|author=Stanley, Nigel|coauthors=Kaufman, Marcia|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used in several different types of packaged [[software application]]s offered by [[independent software vendor]]s (ISVs) and [[original equipment manufacturer]]s ([[OEM]]s). It is also optimized for [[software as a service]] (SaaS) deployment&lt;ref name="Bloor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moving to the Cloud with Pervasive PSQL|url=http://www.pervasivedb.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/WP_Bloor_Moving_to_the_Cloud_with_PSQL_Dec2011.pdf|publisher=The Bloor Group|author=Bloor, Robin|coauthors=Jozwiak, Rebecca|date=December, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to a file-based architecture enabling partitioning of data for [[multitenancy]] needs.

Applications can store the data and the relationships in [[table (database)|tables]] in a [[relational model]] ([[RDBMS]]) or store the data in a [[Database schema|schema]]-less way with no fixed [[data model]] ([[key-value store]]).

Pervasive PSQL runs on system platforms that include [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[MAC OS X]]. Both [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] editions of Pervasive PSQL are available. Editions are also specifically designed for different computer networking [[software deployment|deployment]] needs, such as [[workgroup (computer networking)|workgroup]], [[client-server]], and highly virtualized environments, including [[Cloud computing]].

The original name for Pervasive PSQL was [[Architecture of Btrieve|Btrieve]].&lt;ref name="SQL Guide"&gt;{{cite book|title=The SQL Guide to Pervasive PSQL|year=2009|publisher=Lulu|isbn=9978-0-557-10543-4|pages=44–45|author=van der Lans, Rick F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pervasive Software was acquired by Actian Corporation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actian Corporation and Pervasive Software Unite to Take Action on Big Data|url=http://www.actian.com/press/actian-pervasive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and customers==
Pervasive PSQL has a world-wide presence, but because Pervasive PSQL is an embedded database, its extensiveness is not well known. “Although Pervasive PSQL has been available for more than twenty five years, not many know of its existence. Competing products such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server are, without a doubt, better known and more noticeable. This obscurity is undeserved, because the number of installations worldwide is impressive. ...Organizations buy applications from the ISVs and VARs without knowing that Pervasive PSQL is the engine running all their applications.”&lt;ref name="SQL Guide"/&gt; “The company has 3,500 partners worldwide, including roughly 200 OEMs and 45 distributors who provide some of the traditional services a value-added reseller does, such as training and consulting work.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pervasive’s Tailor-made System|url=http://www.accountingtoday.com/act_issues/2008_5/27975-1.html?pg=1|publisher=Accounting Today|author=DeFelice, Alexandra|date=June 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of Pervasive distributors include Goldstar Software for the US market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldstarsoftware.com/ |title=Goldstar Software Inc. Home Page |publisher=Goldstarsoftware.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOS Software Service AG for the German, Swiss, and Austrian market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos-software.com/ |title=SOS Software Service |publisher=Sos-software.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSCallands and Southdown House Software Ltd. for the United Kingdom and Irish market, Poly-Asia e-Technology for the Chinese and Southeast Asian market, AG-TECH for the Japanese market, and Stern Software for the South American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.com.br/ |title=Stern Software |publisher=Stern.com.br |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pervasive PSQL is embedded by OEMs like [[Sage Group|Sage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagepfw.com/products/pervasivesql.aspx |title=Manufacturing ERP Softwareâ€"Sage PFW ERP |publisher=Sagepfw.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABACUS Research AG (Switzerland), and Unikum (Sweden) in packaged software applications that address the accounting, finance, retail, point-of-sale, entertainment, reservation system, and medical and pharmaceutical industry segments. “Users include Novell, Microsoft, Great Plains Software, PeachTree Software, Fair Isaac, Disney World, Radio Shack, Cardiff and others.”&lt;ref name="Vaughan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pervasive on replication trail|url=http://adtmag.com/articles/2002/10/16/pervasive-on-replication-trail.aspx|publisher=Application Development Trends|author=Vaughan, Jack|date=October 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accounting industry forms a large part of the Pervasive PSQL market. “In the year ended June 30, 2007, approximately 20 percent of database revenues were from sales related to applications from such vendors as Sage, Intuit, Exact Software, Cyma Systems and Epicor.”&lt;ref name="Vaughan"/&gt; An example of the use of PSQL in the medical industry is [[WebMD]].

Historically, Pervasive PSQL has served as a DBMS for the [[Small and medium enterprises|small- to medium-sized business]] (SMB) commercial section. “According to Wayne Kernochan, senior analyst for Illuminata, 'Pervasive takes a different direction from enterprise databases in several different areas, with positive results for low-IT users.'...'Pervasive PSQL is particularly useful and offers especially low TCO in mass-deployment architectures, wherein multiple workgroups or branch offices in multiple localities each use a local server which may be linked back to a central server,’ added Kernochan.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Software provides growth solution for organization databases|url=http://news.thomasnet.com/fullstory/Software-provides-growth-solution-for-organization-databases-531641|publisher=ThomasNet News|date=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DBMS architecture==
{{See also|Architecture of Btrieve}}

Pervasive PSQL supports stand-alone, client-server, [[peer-to-peer]]&lt;ref name="PerDocLib"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pervasive Documentation Library: Pervasive PSQL v11 SP2|url=http://docs.pervasive.com/products/database/psqlv11/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm#href=welcome/libwelcome.html|publisher=Pervasive Software|date=April, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[software-as-a-service]] (SaaS)&lt;ref name="Bloor"/&gt; [[software architecture|architecture]].

The central architecture of Pervasive PSQL consists of two [[database]] engines: (1) the [[storage engine]], known as MicroKernel Database Engine (MKDE) and described by Pervasive Software as a [[database transaction|transactional database]] engine and (2) the [[relational database]] engine, known as SQL Relational Database Engine (SRDE). Both engines can access the same data, but the methods of [[data access]] differ. “On the one hand, you can program against the database using standard ANSI SQL. …But Pervasive also allows you to go under the hood and bypass SQL totally….With Pervasive you can use low-level operations to access the data directly.”&lt;ref name="Lax"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top-notch Auditing an Impressive Add-on for Pervasive.SQL|url=http://www.devx.com/dbzone/Article/20006|publisher=DevX.com|author=Lax, Joe|date=January 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MicroKernel Database Engine===

Pervasive’s transactional database engine, the MicroKernel Database Engine, interacts directly with the data and does not require fixed data schema to access the data. It uses key-value store to store and access the data. Calls to the MKDE are made programmatically with [[Btrieve]] API&lt;ref name="PerDocLib"/&gt; rather than through the use of a [[query language]]; therefore, Pervasive PSQL does not have to [[parse]] the request. This places the MicroKernel Database Engine in the category of NoSQL databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIST OF NOSQL DATABASES|url=http://nosql-database.org/|publisher=NoSQL|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low-level API calls and memory caching of data reduce the time required to manipulate data.

The MKDE operates in complete database transactions and guarantees full ACID ([[Atomicity (database systems)|Atomicity]], [[Consistency (database systems)|Consistency]], [[Isolation (database systems)|Isolation]], [[Durability (database systems)|Durability]]).&lt;ref name="Weijers"/&gt; If a transaction does not fully run its course due to an external event such as a power interruption, the data remains in the state in which it existed before the transaction began to run.

In the MKDE, records are stored in [[computer file|files]] which are roughly equivalent to the tables of a relational database engine. It supports multiple [[Unique key|key]]s on a record and therefore multiple indexes in the file. The MKDE caches data in memory to facilitate performance. When a call is made to the MKDE, [[cache (computing)|cache]]d data is searched first; physical storage is searched if there is no cache of the data. [[Computer configuration|Configuration]] settings for caches can be pre-configured by [[Independent software vendor|ISVs]] to optimize Pervasive PSQL performance for their applications.

===Relational Database Engine===

The second database engine, the SQL Relational Database Engine or SRDE, operates in a manner similar to other relational database engines, that is, through the support of [[Structured Query Language]] queries. SRDE parses [[SQL]] queries and sends them to the MKDE to run.

The SRDE implements [[SQL-92]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Methods for interacting with a Pervasive SQL database|url=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/405640/methods-for-interacting-with-a-pervasive-sql-database|publisher=stackoverflow|author=Brettski|date=January 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant other features include relational [[data integrity|integrity]], [[database security]], and temporary tables. SRDE extends its functionality by supporting [[stored procedure]]s, [[user-defined function]]s, and [[database trigger|triggers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The SQL Guide to Pervasive PSQL|year=2009|publisher=Lulu|isbn=9978-0-557-10543-4|pages=443–548|author=van der Lans, Rick F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its support for SQL-92, the SRDE supports several significant features of [[COBOL]]: COBOL [[data types]] and COBOL OCCURS and VARIANT records.&lt;ref name="PerDocLib"/&gt;

==Interfaces==
[[File:Interfaces to Pervasive PSQL.png|500 px|right|Interfaces for Pervasive PSQL]]
Pervasive PSQL [[interface (computing)|interfaces]] fall into two categories: management interfaces and [[data manipulation]] interfaces.

===Management interfaces===

Pervasive Software provides the management interfaces Distributed Tuning Interface (DTI)&lt;ref name="PerDocLib"/&gt; and Distributed Tuning Objects (DTO), a [[Component Object Model]] (COM) [[adapter pattern]] (wrapper) for the DTI.&lt;ref name="PerDocLib"/&gt; These provide [[application programming interface]]s for configuration, monitoring, and diagnostics of Pervasive components. COBOL can also provide component management through a COBOL connector that can talk to DTI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pervasive Documentation Library: Pervasive PSQL v10|url=http://www.pervasivedb.com/support/Documents/Docs2/Active_Connector_ACUCOBOL-GT_Developer_Guide.pdf|publisher=Pervasive Software|date=April, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application interfaces===

All other interfaces&lt;ref name="PerDocLib"/&gt; exist for data manipulation purposes.
* Btrieve, [[Java Class Library]] (JCL), COBOL, and [[ActiveX]] provides direct access to the MicroKernel Database Engine (MKDE).
* [[ADO.NET]]; [[ODBC]] v3.51 and [[JDBC]] 2 for Core, Level 1, and Level 2; and [[OLE DB]] provide access to the SQL Relational Database Engine (SRDE).
* Pervasive Direct Access Components (PDAC) are a set of [[Visual Component Library]] (VCL) components that enable direct access to both MKDE and SRDE for [[Embarcadero Delphi]] and [[C++ Builder]] environments.

==Tools==

Pervasive provides [[utility software]] designed to facilitate administration and use of Pervasive PSQL.&lt;ref name="PerDocLib"/&gt; There are graphical and [[command line]] utilities in [[Windows]], Linux, and [[Mac OS X]] environments.

Pervasive Control Center (PCC) is the main utility that enables the user to create and manipulate databases and tables, to access [[server (computing)|servers]] and clients, to set configuration, properties, and to edit data. Through PCC, the user can access a series of other utilities:
* License Administrator utility handles [[license management]] activities.
* Notification Viewer utility displays licensing-related messages logged by the PSQL engine.
* Monitor utility checks and displays activities and attributes of both engines, including [[resource (computer science)|resource]] usage, [[session (computer science)|session]] information, and communication statistics.
* Pervasive System Analyzer utility tests the connections between the engines and within the [[Computer network|network]] and displays information about system components.
* Maintenance utility enables users to create and edit schema-less files.
* Rebuild utility enables users to convert [[file format]]s and rebuild files in its MKDE file format.
* DDF ([[data definition]] file) Builder utility enables SQL users to create and modify table schemas for data stored in the MKDE, thus providing relational access to the data.
* Query Plan Viewer enables SQL users to analyze [[query plan]]s for [[program optimization|optimization]].
* Function Executor assists developers with [[Software development|development]], [[Software testing|testing]], and [[debugging]] by simulating direct [[API]] operations into MKDE and providing a view into the schema-less data.

==Versions==

See [[Btrieve]], beginning with Pervasive.SQL 7.

==Editions and licensing==

===Editions===

There are four editions of PSQL&lt;ref name="PerDocLib"/&gt;: Pervasive PSQL Client, Pervasive PSQL Workgroup, Pervasive PSQL Server, and Pervasive PSQL Vx Server.
* Pervasive PSQL Client is designed for use with Pervasive PSQL Server and Pervasive PSQL Vx Server in a client-server network.
* Pervasive PSQL Workgroup edition is intended for [[single-user]] or small workgroup, peer-to-peer, installations.&lt;ref name="PerDocLib"/&gt;
* Pervasive PSQL Server edition is intended for configurations that have at minimum ten [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] connections and it is scalable up to thousands of concurrent network users in client-server network and [[web-based application]]s on the [[enterprise software|enterprise]] level.&lt;ref name="PerDocLib"/&gt;
* PSQL Vx Server runs under [[hypervisor]]s in a [[virtual machine|VM]] environment. It is designed for customers “who need support for highly virtualized environments enabling live migration, fault tolerance, high availability and cloud computing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pervasive Software Announces Hypervisor-Friendly PSQl Vx Server 11|url=http://www.serverwatch.com/server-news/pervasive-software-announces-hypervisor-friendly-psql-vx-server-11-.html|publisher=ServerWatch|author=Beal, Vangie|date=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licensing===

Pervasive Software uses two different [[software license agreement|licensing]] models, user-count licensing and capacity-based licensing.&lt;ref name="PerDocLib"/&gt;
* In user-count licensing, each [[product key]] specifies a licensed user. At any given moment, that many users can be connected to the engine.
* Capacity-based licensing is based on the amount of [[process (computing)|process]]ing performed by the database engine. It measures data in use and sessions in use. This license model is designed to facilitate Cloud computing and highly virtualized environments.

Both PSQL Server and PSQL Workgroup use a user-count licensing model, while PSQL Vx Server uses capacity-based licensing.

==Limitations==

* Pervasive PSQL lacks some of the [[data warehousing]], [[data mining]], and reporting services built into database engines such as [[MySQL]] and [[Microsoft SQL Server]].&lt;ref name="Lax"/&gt;
* Pervasive PSQL lacks Unicode support in the RDBMS layer.
* Pervasive PSQL lacks the ability to perform [[distributed transaction]]s.
