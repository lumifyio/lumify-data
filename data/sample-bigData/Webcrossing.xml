'''Webcrossing''', also known as '''Webx forum software''', '''Webx''' and '''Web Crossing''' is an object-oriented, scriptable web-based collaboration server with forums, post-by-email, built-in [[web server]], email server and an ftp server. It includes a native object-oriented NoSQL database and server-side scripting.
The purpose of Webcrossing is to drive [[internet forum]]s,  social networks and Web 2.0 applications. It differs from [[phpBB]] and other forum engines in that it includes (1) a native object-oriented NoSQL database, (2) built-in servers for HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, NNTP and other protocols. Server-side JavaScript allows for overwriting existing features and adding new web applications and features. It is the main program at the [http://community.eldis.org Eldis Communities] website, as well as at [http://edWeb.net edWeb.net].

It is highly customizable via control panels and scripting, is very reliable, has built-in cluster support for large-scale growth and has a convenient user interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/archive/newsletters/v97n1/computers/webx.asp Webcrossing review] by Lawrence M.

It was originally designed by Lundeen &amp; Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/834/oocom.htm Creating A Community], by Teresa W.
