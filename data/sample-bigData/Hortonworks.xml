'''Hortonworks''' is an enterprise software company based in Palo Alto, California. The company focuses on the development and support of [[Apache Hadoop]], a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hadoop.apache.org/ What Is Apache Hadoop], Apache Software Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; The company's product is the Hortonworks Data Platform. 

==History==

Hortonworks was formed in 2011 by [[Yahoo!]] and [[Benchmark Capital]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/development/database/231000658?queryText=hortonworks Hadoop Big Data Startup Spins Out Of Yahoo], InformationWeek, 2011-6-29&lt;/ref&gt; and is an independent company. The company employs the  architects and contributors to the [[open source]] [[Apache Hadoop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/47123495|title=Big-data investors look for the next Splunk|work=[[CNBC]]|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional investors include [[Index Ventures]].  

Hortonworks is a sponsor of the [[Apache Software Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html Sponsors], Apache Software Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forrester Research]] named Hortonworks “the technology leader and ecosystem builder for the entire Hadoop industry.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hortonworks-recognized-as-a-leader-in-the-enterprise-hadoop-solutions-industry-by-independent-research-firm-2012-02-06 Hortonworks Recognized as a Leader in the Enterprise Hadoop Solutions Industry by Independent Research Firm], MarketWatch, 2011-2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

The Hortonworks Data Platform is powered by [[Apache Hadoop]] and is an [[open source]] platform for storing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of data. The platform is designed to deal with data from many sources and formats in a simple and cost-effective manner. The platform provides an open, stable and highly extensible platform that makes it easier to integrate Apache Hadoop with existing data architectures and maximize the value of the data flowing through a business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/242916/hortonworks_hones_a_hadoop_distribution.html HortonWorks Hones a Hadoop Distribution], PC World, 2011-11-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform includes various [[Apache Hadoop]] projects including the [[HDFS|Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)]], [[MapReduce]], Pig, Hive, [[HBase]] and Zookeeper and additional components that make the Hadoop platform more manageable, open, and extensible.

On Feb 25th 2013, Hortonworks announced availability of a beta version of the Hortonworks Data Platform for Windows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/242916/hortonworks_hones_a_hadoop_distribution.html HortonWorks Hones a Hadoop Distribution], PC World, 2011-11-1&lt;/ref&gt;
