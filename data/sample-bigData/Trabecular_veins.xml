The '''trabecular veins''' are the largest veins inside the [[spleen]]. It drains the blood collected in the sinuses of the pulp.

==Details==
The blood is collected from the interstices of the tissue by the rootlets of the [[veins]], which begin much in the same way as the [[arteries]] end. 

The [[connective-tissue]] corpuscles of the pulp arrange themselves in rows, in such a way as to form an elongated space or sinus. 

They become elongated and spindle-shaped, and overlap each other at their extremities, and thus form a sort of [[endothelial]] lining of the path or sinus, which is the radicle of a vein. 

On the outer surfaces of these cells are seen delicate transverse lines or markings, which are due to minute elastic fibrill√¶ arranged in a circular manner around the sinus. 

Thus the channel obtains an external investment, and gradually becomes converted into a small vein, which after a short course acquires a coat of ordinary connective tissue, lined by a layer of flattened epithelial cells which are continuous with the supporting cells of the pulp. 

The smaller veins unite to form larger ones; these do not accompany the arteries, but soon enter the trabecular sheaths of the capsule, and by their junction form six or more branches, which emerge from the [[Splenic hilum|hilum]], and, uniting, constitute the [[lienal vein]], the largest radicle of the [[portal vein]].
