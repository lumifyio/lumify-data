'''Hopper''' is an in-development travel search and recommendation engine, powered by the world's largest structured database of travel information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hopper's About page|url=http://hopper.com/corp/about.html|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hopper is a big-data start-up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alspach|first=Kyle|title=Hopper raises $12M to pioneer data-powered travel planning|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/startups/2012/08/hopper-travel-site-raises-12-million.html|publisher=Boston Business Journal|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that was founded in [[Montreal, Canada]], in 2007 by CEO Frederic Lelonde, CTO Joost Ouwerkerk, and developer Sebastien Rainville with the goal of becoming "the [[Google]] of travel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirsner|first=Scott|title=Website hopes to add retro to travel planning|url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2011/08/08/site_takes_retro_approach_to_travel_planning/|publisher=Boston.com|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine's search results will build custom pages of travel information from its index of one billion web sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hopper's Facebook page|url=https://www.facebook.com/155688707787821/timeline/story?ut=32&amp;wstart=1349074800&amp;wend=1351753199&amp;hash=466271513396204&amp;pagefilter=3&amp;ustart=1|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 10 million physical things, like hotels and restaurants, scraped from user-generated content from all around the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alspach|first=Kyle|title=Music, travel businesses tune in to ‘big data’|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/print-edition/2012/06/01/music-travel-businesses-tune-in-to.html?page=2|publisher=Boston Business Journal|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company is currently headquartered in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], in the [[Kendall Boiler and Tank Company]] building, and also maintains an office in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hopper's "About" page|url=http://www.hopper.com/corp/about.html|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
In 2008, the company secured $2 million in funding. In 2011, a second round of funding secured $8 million from [[Atlas Venture]] and [[Brightspark Ventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hopper Raises $8M to Reinvent Travel Search|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Hopper-Raises-8M-Reinvent-iw-718821752.html|publisher=Yahoo Finance|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Hopper secured $12 million from [[OMERS Ventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ogg|first=Erica|title=Hopper gets another $12M to organize the web’s travel data|url=http://gigaom.com/2012/08/15/hopper-gets-another-12m-to-organize-the-webs-travel-data/|publisher=GigaOM|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hack/reduce==
In May 2012, Hopper CEO Frederic Lelonde and entrepreneur [[Christopher P. Lynch]] founded [[Hack/reduce]], a non-profit hacker space designed to attract and foster big-data talent in the Boston area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Latamore|first=Bert|title=Hopper Brings Big-Data-as-a-Service to Online Travel Planning|url=http://servicesangle.com/blog/2012/06/28/hopper-brings-big-data-as-a-service-to-online-travel-planning/|publisher=Services Angle|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack/reduce, which is located in the same building as Hopper's offices, has partnered with [[MIT]], [[CSAIL]], and [[Harvard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rousmaniere|first=Dana|title=Harvard Business Review interview with Lelonde|url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/10/what_could_you_accomplish_with.html|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has received a grant from Governor [[Deval Patrick]] as part of his Massachusetts Big Data Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Governor Patrick Announces New Initiative To Strengthen Massachusetts’ Position As A World Leader In Big Data|url=http://www.mass.gov/governor/pressoffice/pressreleases/2012/2012530-governor-announces-big-data-initiative.html|work=The Official Website of the Governor of Massachusetts|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
