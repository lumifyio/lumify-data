'''Windows Azure''' is a [[cloud computing]] platform and infrastructure, created by [[Microsoft]], for building, deploying and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed [[datacenter]]s.  It provides both [[platform as a service]] (PaaS) and [[infrastructure as a service]] (IaaS) services and supports many different [[programming language]]s, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems. Windows Azure was released on February 1, 2010.&lt;ref name="avail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2010/02/01/windows-azure-general-availability.aspx |title=Windows Azure General Availability - The Official Microsoft Blog - Site Home - TechNet Blogs |publisher=Blogs.technet.com |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

Windows Azure is Microsoft's cloud [[application platform]]. Windows Azure can be used to build a [[web application]] that runs and stores its data in Microsoft datacenters.  It can connect on-premises applications with each other or map between different sets of identity information.

In June 2012, Windows Azure released the following new features:

* Websites allows developers to build sites using [[ASP.NET]], [[PHP]], or [[Node.js]] and can be deployed using [[FTP]], [[Git (software)|Git]], or [[Team Foundation Server]].
* Virtual machines let developers migrate applications and infrastructure without changing existing code, and can run both [[Windows Server]] and Linux [[virtual machine]]s.
* Cloud services - Microsoft's Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment that is used to create scalable applications and services. Supports multi-tier scenarios and automated deployments.
* Data management - SQL Database, formerly known as [[SQL Azure]] Database, works to create, scale and extend applications into the cloud using [[Microsoft SQL Server]] technology. Integrates with [[Active Directory]] and [[Microsoft System Center]] and [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]].
* Media services - A PaaS offering that can be used for encoding, [[content protection]], streaming, and/or analytics.

The Windows Azure Platform provides an [[Application programming interface|API]] built on [[REST]], [[HTTP]], and [[XML]] that allows a developer to interact with the services provided by Windows Azure. Microsoft also provides a client-side managed class library which encapsulates the functions of interacting with the services. It also integrates with [[Microsoft Visual Studio]], Git, and [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].

In October 2012, Microsoft released a [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35473 downloadable PDF poster] that summarizes Windows Azure and the features in it. The PDF contains clickable areas pointing to additional documentation.

==Services==
* Web sites - High density hosting of web sites. This feature was announced in preview form in June 2012 at the Meet Windows Azure event.&lt;ref name=meetnew&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/06/07/meet-the-new-windows-azure.aspx |title=Meet Windows Azure event June 2012 |publisher=Weblogs.asp.net |date=2012-06-07 |accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Customers can create web sites in PHP, [[.NET Framework|.NET]], and Node.js, or select from several open source applications from a gallery to deploy. This comprises one aspect of the [[Platform as a service|Platform as a Service (PaaS)]] offerings for the Windows Azure Platform.
* Virtual machines - Announced in preview form at the Meet Windows Azure event in June 2012&lt;ref name=meetnew/&gt; the Windows Azure Virtual Machines comprise the [[Infrastructure as a service|Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]] offering from Microsoft for their public cloud. Customers can create Virtual Machines, of which they have complete control, to run the Microsoft Data Centers.  As of the preview the Virtual Machines supported [[Windows Server]] 2008 and 2012 operating systems and a few distributions of Linux. Since May 2013, the Virtual Machine offering left the preview state and went into General Availability state (GA).
* Cloud services - Previously named "Hosted Services", the Cloud Services for Windows Azure comprise one aspect of the PaaS offerings from the Windows Azure Platform.  The Cloud Services are containers of hosted applications.  These applications can be internet-facing public web applications (such as web sites and [[e-commerce]] solutions), or they can be private processing engines for other work, such as processing orders or analyzing data.
** Developers can write code for Cloud Services in a variety of different programming languages; however, there are specific [[Software development kit|software development kits]] (SDKs) started by Microsoft for [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Node.js|node.JS]] and [[.NET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/overview/ |title=Windows Azure Documentation: Get started building cloud applications |publisher=Windowsazure.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other languages may have support through Open Source projects.  Microsoft published the [[source code]] for their client libraries on [[GitHub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/WindowsAzure |title=WindowsAzure (Windows Azure) 路 GitHub |publisher=Github.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Windows Azure uses a specialized operating system, called Windows Azure, to run its "fabric layer" — a cluster hosted at Microsoft's datacenters that manages computing and storage resources of the computers and provisions the resources (or a subset of them) to applications running on top of Windows Azure. Windows Azure has been described as a "cloud layer" on top of a number of Windows Server systems, which use Windows Server 2008 and a customized version of [[Hyper-V]], known as the Windows Azure [[Hypervisor]] to provide virtualization of services.
Scaling and reliability are controlled by the Windows Azure Fabric Controller so the services and environment do not crash if one of the servers crashes within the Microsoft [[datacenter]] and provides the management of the user's web application like memory resources and load balancing.

===Deployment in Ireland===
As of July 2010, Microsoft had completed 6,000 installations of Azure in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Sunday Business Post"&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2010/07/04/story50200.asp Sunday Business Post]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executives at Microsoft hoped that this figure would rise to 100,000 installations by 2011.&lt;ref name="Sunday Business Post"/&gt;

Construction of the $500 million facility required 1 million man-hours of work with a peak workforce of around 2,100 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/emea/presscentre/pressreleases/DublinDataCentrePR_240909.mspx|title = Microsoft’s new Dublin Data Centre to support demand for online services for business and consumers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility, which began operating on July 1, 2009, currently covers 303,000 square feet (2.815 hectares), with 5.4 megawatts of critical power available. Over time, the data center can expand to a total of 22.2 mega watts of critical power to support future growth.

==Privacy==
Microsoft has stated that, per the [[USA Patriot Act]], the US government can have access to the data even if the hosted company is not American and the data resides outside the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Toor |first=Amar |url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/30/microsoft-european-cloud-data-may-not-be-immune-to-the-patriot/ |title=Microsoft: European cloud data may not be immune to the Patriot Act |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Windows Azure is compliant with the [[Data Protection Directive|E.U. Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC)]]. To manage Privacy and Security related concerns, Microsoft has created a Windows Azure Trust Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/support/trust-center/ |title=Windows Azure Trust Center |publisher=Windowsazure.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Windows Azure has several of its services compliant with several compliance programs including [[ISO 27001:2005]] and [[HIPAA]]. A full and current listing can be found on the Windows Azure Trust Center Compliance page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/support/trust-center/compliance/ |title=Windows Azure Trust Center Compliance |publisher=Windowsazure.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
