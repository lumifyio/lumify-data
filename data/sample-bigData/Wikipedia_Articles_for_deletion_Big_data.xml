Contested prod. "Big" is an adjective that can be combined with many words; there is nothing novel or notable about its use with "data" - indeed, data is more likely to be described as "large" (Google gives more than 10 times as many hits for "large data" over "big data"). Even "large data" is merely a dictionary term; for an article on the particular difficulties that large data presents, the article [[Computer data processing]] might be a good place to start.

'''delete''' - can't see any reliable sources here. [[User:Theserialcomma|Theserialcomma]] ([[User talk:Theserialcomma|talk]]) 02:31, 10 November 2009 (UTC)
:You don't think Nature is a reliable source? There is an entire issue of Nature dedicated to the subject. --[[User:Nickg|Nick]] ([[User talk:Nickg|talk]]) 02:40, 11 November 2009 (UTC)
::yes, nature is a reliable source, but the nature reference somehow doesn't really fit in the article. is big data a neologism or a dictionary definition? [[User:Theserialcomma|Theserialcomma]] ([[User talk:Theserialcomma|talk]]) 03:01, 11 November 2009 (UTC)

*'''Delete''', seems like just a neologism. The only provided reference, the Nature article, doesn't actually even mention the term "big data", instead talking about big data sets. [[User:JIP|&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt;J&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#00CC00"&gt;I&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#0000CC"&gt;P&lt;/font&gt;]] | [[User talk:JIP|Talk]] 07:09, 16 November 2009 (UTC)

* The term "big data" is increasingly used in discussions about scientific research and web platforms. Perhaps the problem is that its notability isn't apparent from this very short stub. [[User:Neilfws|Neilfws]] ([[User talk:Neilfws|talk]]) 00:32, 18 November 2009 (UTC)

* Keep.  As an example of notability, there's a entire special issue of Nature with the title "Big Data", and the term is used with increasing frequency by scientists.   The Nature link is: http://www.nature.com/news/specials/bigdata/index.html  Agree with Neilfws that the stub needs to be better fleshed out for the notability to be apparent.--[[User:Nielsen|Michael Nielsen]] ([[User talk:Nielsen|talk]]) 01:13, 18 November 2009 (UTC)

*'''Delete''', documenting a neologism. &lt;font face="Cambria"&gt;[[User:Abductive|&lt;font color="teal"&gt;'''Abductive'''&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:Abductive|reasoning]])&lt;/font&gt; 07:07, 24 November 2009 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' as per nom - it is simply a combination of ''big'' and ''data'', dictionary words which have no place here. I'm not even sure it's a neologism, and even if it was it doesn't need an article. [[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]] ([[User talk:JohnBlackburne|talk]]) 11:58, 24 November 2009 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. It is not an article subject. Special techniques for handling large data sets can be covered in other articles. Nothing here worth merging though. --[[User:DanielRigal|DanielRigal]] ([[User talk:DanielRigal|talk]]) 12:38, 24 November 2009 (UTC)
