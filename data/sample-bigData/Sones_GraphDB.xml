'''Sones GraphDB''' was declared bankrupt in Germany 01.01.2012


'''Sones GraphDB''' was developed by the company ''sones'' in [[Erfurt]] and [[Leipzig]]. ''GraphDB'' is a new type of database with its design based on weighted graphs. The open source edition has been available since July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/open/meldung/sones-gibt-Quellcode-der-GraphDB-frei-1032398.html Announcement of open source version (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; The commercially available enterprise version offers a wider variety of functions.

''GraphDB'' was entirely developed in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and runs on  [[Microsoft]]'s [[.NET Framework|.Net]] platform as well as on the open source reimplementation [[Mono (software)|Mono]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_2.8 Mono Release Notes 2.8 mit Verweis auf GraphDB]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2010-09-11-004-35-NW-SW .NET versus Mono Benchmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

''GraphDB'' is available as SaaS on the [[Microsoft]] cloud [[Azure Services Platform]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/developer/meldung/GraphDB-als-SaaS-fuer-Windows-Azure-1049816.html Azure SaaS Announcement (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company ''sones'' is a member of [[Lisog]]; ''GraphDB'' is a component of the open source [[solution stack]].

== Functionality  ==
=== Index-free adjacency ===
Graph databases like the sones GraphDB address the paradigm of the index-free [[adjacent (graph theory)|adjacency]]. That means that is not necessary to manage a global index for relationships between nodes/entities. The linked objects contain direct reference to their adjacent neighboring nodes.

=== Handling semi-structured data===
The semi-structured data approach was established in the mid-90s. This approach is based on the fact that many application areas rarely allow a structured table structure due to complex information characteristics. An example of such problem domains can be found in bioinformatics or the Semantic Web. The sones graph database is able to store and retrieve unstructured properties in any node of the graph. The idea is also to transfer unstructured data to structured data and vice versa.

===Dynamic type extension===
Another advantage is that structured data can be dynamically extended with high performance in nodes and edges during runtime. Additional properties can easily be entered or deleted from vertex types in a short amount of time. The number of nodes is irrelevant here.

===Graph query language===
The sones GraphQL is a user-friendly domain-specific language and can be thought of as an "SQL for graphs." The similarity to SQL is intentional and makes the transition much easier for developers/consultants. It enables queries to the sones graph database property hypergraph and can be dynamically extended during runtime using plugins such as functions or aggregates.

===Solving the object-relational depiction problem===
''sones'' ''GraphDB'' solves this problem by using an object-oriented concept. This results in better integration into object-oriented languages, since no O/R mapper is required.

== Interfaces ==
=== REST API===
In addition to providing a number of interfaces (e.g., [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], WebShell, [[WebDAV]]) the ''sones'' graph database also offers a REST API. This enables uncomplicated interaction with state-of-the-art web technologies. A REST-query is all that is required to execute CRUD operations directly on the database.

=== Traverser API ===
The Traverser API makes it possible to analyze local data. Based on a number of nodes (local), neighboring nodes can be searched recursively (breadth/depth first).

== Architecture ==
The ''sones'' ''GraphDB'' has a modular structure consisting of 4 application layers. The storage engines act as the interface to different storage media. The ''GraphFS'' serializes and deserializes database objects (nodes and edges) and operates the available storage engines. The actual graph-oriented database logic as well as all functionalities specific to the database are implemented in the ''GraphDB''. The ''GraphDS'' provides the interface for using the database. The interfaces between the application layers are generic, which makes it possible to update components separately.
