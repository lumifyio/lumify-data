'''Charlottenburg''' is an affluent [[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|locality]] of [[Berlin]] within the borough of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]]. Established as a [[German town law|town]] in 1705 and named after late [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]], Queen consort of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], it is best known for [[Charlottenburg Palace]], the largest surviving royal [[palace]] in Berlin, and the adjacent museums.

Charlottenburg was an independent city to the west of Berlin until 1920 when it was incorporated into "[[Greater Berlin Act|Groß-Berlin]]" (Greater Berlin) and transformed into a borough. In the course of [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]] it was merged with the former borough of [[Wilmersdorf]] becoming a part of a new borough called [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]]. Later, in 2004, the new borough's districts were rearranged, dividing the former borough of Charlottenburg into the localities of Charlottenburg proper, [[Westend (Berlin)|Westend]] and [[Charlottenburg-Nord]].

==Geography==
[[File:Funkturm Berlin View 08.jpg|thumb|left|View from [[Funkturm Berlin]] to Charlottenburg, and Berlin city centre in the background]]
Charlottenburg is located in Berlin's [[inner city]], west of the [[Großer Tiergarten|Tiergarten]] park. Its historic core, the former [[village green]] of Alt Lietzow, is situated on the southern shore of the [[Spree]] River running through the Berlin [[glacial valley]]. The [[Straße des 17. Juni]] road, former Charlottenburger Chaussee, which runs eastwards from [[Charlottenburg Gate]] through the Tiergarten park to [[Brandenburg Gate]], connects Charlottenburg with the historic centre of Berlin-[[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]]. 

In the north and west, the [[Berlin Ringbahn]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 100]] (''Stadtring'') mark the border with the Charlottenburg-Nord and Westend suburbs. Adjacent in the south is the territory of [[Wilmersdorf]]. Charlottenburg also borders on the districts of [[Halensee]] in the southwest as well as [[Moabit]], [[Hansaviertel]], [[Tiergarten]] and [[Schöneberg]] in the east.

==History==

=== Early settlements ===
Archaeological findings in the area of Alt Lietzow date back to the [[Neolithic]] era. Within the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], on the land occupied by nowadays Charlottenburg there were three settlements in the late Middle Ages: the farmsteads Lietzow (pronounced leat-tsow) south of the Spree and Casow (pr. caasow) beyond the river, as well as a further settlement called [[Glienicke]] (pr. gleanicke). Although these names are of [[Polabian Slavs|Slavic]] origin, the settlements are likely to have had a mixed Slavic and [[German people|German]] population.

Lietzow (also called ''Lietze'', ''Lutze'', ''Lutzen'', ''Lütze'', ''Lützow'', ''Lusze'' and ''Lucene'') is first documented in a 1239 deed. In 1315, Lietzow and Casow became the property of the ''Sankt Marien'' [[abbey|nunnery]] in nearby [[Spandau (locality)|Spandau]]. As a result, the Lietzow farmstead probably was expanded to a village. In the course of the [[Protestant Reformation]], Elector [[Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg]] confiscated the estates and dissolved the nunnery in 1558. 

While the Lietzow area has been populated continuously, Casow and Glienicke were abandoned. From old field names it is believed that Glienicke lay in the area of the present day streets Kantstraße, Fasanenstraße, [[Kurfürstendamm]] and Uhlandstraße at the former ''Gliniker Lake'' (now dry, there's another [[Glienicke Lake]] in the [[Wannsee]] locality).

The development of Lietzow is well documented. For more than four hundred years, members of the Berendt family were mayors and thus had to pay lower taxes. Ecclesiastically, Lietzow came under the Wilmersdorf parish, the priests reached it from there by the so-called ''Priesterweg'' (priest's way), on the line of the streets now called Leibnizstraße, Konstanzer Straße and Brandenburgische Straße.

===Charlottenburg palace===
[[Image:Schloss-Charlottenburg.jpg|thumb|left|Charlottenburg palace]]
{{Main|Charlottenburg Palace}}
In 1695, [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]] received Lietzow from her husband, Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III of Brandenburg]], in exchange for her estates in [[Caputh, Brandenburg|Caputh]] and Langerwisch near [[Potsdam]]. Frederick had a summer residence built there for Sophie Charlotte by the architect [[Johann Arnold Nering]] between 1695 and 1699. After he had crowned himself Frederick I, [[King in Prussia]], the palace was extended into a stately building with a cours d'honneur. This work was supervised by the Swedish master builder [[Johann Friedrich Eosander]]. Shortly after the death of Sophie Charlotte, the settlement facing the palace was called ''Charlottenburg'' - the palace itself ''Schloss Charlottenburg'' - and chartered as a [[German town law|town]] on April 5, 1705. The king was the town's mayor until the historic village of Lietzow was incorporated into Charlottenburg in 1720.

Frederick's successor as king, [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], rarely stayed at the palace, which depressed the small town of Charlottenburg. Frederick William even tried to revoke the town's privileges. It was not until 1740, at the coronation of his successor [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], that the town's significance increased, as regular celebrations were held again at the palace. The eastern New Wing was built by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]] between 1740 and 1747 as Frederick the Great's residence. Later, Frederick II preferred the palace of [[Sanssouci]], which he had partly designed himself.

When Frederick II died in 1786, his nephew [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] succeeded him, and Charlottenburg became his favourite residence, as it was for his son and successor [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]]. After the defeat of the [[Prussian army]] at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena]] in 1806, Charlottenburg was occupied by the [[First French Empire|French]]. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] occupied the palace, while his troops made [[military camp|camp]] nearby. Charlottenburg became part of the new Prussian [[Province of Brandenburg]] in 1815 after the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

===Recreational and residential area===
In the late 18th century, Charlottenburg's development did not depend only on the crown. The town became a recreational area for the expanding city of [[Berlin]]. Its first true inn opened in the 1770s, in the street then called ''Berliner Straße'' (now ''Otto-Suhr-Allee''), and many other inns and beer gardens were to follow, popular for weekend parties especially. Berliners seeking leisure and entertainment came by boat, by carriage and later by horse-drawn [[Berlin tram|trams]], above all to a large amusement park at the shore of the Spree river called ''Flora'', that went into bankruptcy in 1904.

From the 1860s on the wealthy Bourgeoisie of Berlin discovered Charlottenburg as a residential area, among the first were [[Gerson von Bleichröder]] and [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]], who had a villa built in the ''Berliner Straße'' in 1862. At the same time industrial companies like [[Siemens &amp; Halske]] and [[Schering AG|Schering]] erected large factories in the north-east, at the border with the [[Moabit]] district of Berlin. In 1877 Charlottenburg received [[town privileges]] and until [[World War I]] saw an enormous increase of population with 100,000 inhabitants as of 1893 and a population of 306,000 in 1920, being the second largest city within the [[Province of Brandenburg]], after Berlin. 

The development was accompanied by an [[urban planning]] of broad streets and sidewalks, parks and spacious residential buildings, especially around the southern [[Kurfürstendamm]] area, which enabled large parts of Charlottenburg to preserve their affluent residential character. "The richest town of Prussia" established a ''Royal Technical College'' in 1879 (which later became the [[Berlin Institute of Technology]]), followed by the ''[[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt]]'' and the [[Berlin University of the Arts|College of the Fine Arts]]. A new [[Charlottenburg Town Hall|town hall]] with a {{convert|88|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall spire was erected on the occasion of its 200-year jubilee in 1905 and an [[Deutsche Oper Berlin|opera house]] opened in 1912. The history of Charlottenburg as a municipality in its own right ended with the [[Greater Berlin Act]] of October 1, 1920, when the town became a part of Berlin. The Province of Brandenburg was administered in Charlottenburg from 1918 until the province's dissolution in 1946 after [[World War II]].

===Borough of Berlin===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}
In the 1920s the area around the Kurfürstendamm evolved into the "New West" of Berlin, a development that had already started around 1900 with the opening of the [[Theater des Westens]], the ''Café des Westens'' and the [[Kaufhaus des Westens]], followed by several theatres, cinemas, bars and restaurants, which made Charlottenburg the Berlin centre of leisure and nightlife. Artists like 
[[Alfred Döblin]], [[Otto Dix]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Else Lasker-Schüler]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[Stefan Zweig]] and [[Friedrich Hollaender]] socialized in the legendary [[Romanisches Café]] at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]]. However the days of the [[1920s Berlin|Golden Twenties]] came to an end with the rise of the [[Nazi Party]]. In [[World War II]] the area around the [[Breitscheidplatz]] was heavily damaged by [[Allied bombing of Berlin in World War II|air raids]] and the [[Battle of Berlin]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Nevertheless after 1945 the Kurfürstendamm area quickly regained its importance, as with the partition of the city in the [[Cold War]] it became the commercial centre of [[West-Berlin]]. It was therefore the site of protests and major demonstrations of the late 1960s [[German student movement]], that culminated on June 2, 1967 when student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot by a police officer during a demonstration against [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]] at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin|Deutsche Oper]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Before the reunification of Berlin, Charlottenburg was the center of West Berlin, with many high market bars and restaurants. After 1990 [[German reunification]] Charlottenburg struggled with the rise of the [[Mitte]] borough as Berlin's historic centre.&lt;ref&gt;Schulte-Peevers, Andrea. ''Lonely Planet Germany''.
