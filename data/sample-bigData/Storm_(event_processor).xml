'''Storm''' is a [[Complex event processing|complex event processor]] and distributed computation framework written predominantly in the [[Clojure]] programming language. Originally created by Nathan Marz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marz|first=Nathan|title=About Nathan Marz|url=http://nathanmarz.com/about/|publisher=Nathan Marz|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and team at BackType,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BackType Website|url=http://www.backtype.com/|publisher=BackType|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project was open sourced after being acquired by Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Storm is coming: more details and plans for release|url=http://engineering.twitter.com/2011/08/storm-is-coming-more-details-and-plans.html|work=Engineering Blog|publisher=Twitter Inc|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses custom created "spouts" and "bolts" to define information sources and manipulations to allow batch, distributed processing of streaming data. The initial release was on September 17, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm Codebase|url=https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/commit/9d91adbdbde22e91779b91eb40805f598da5b004|publisher=Github|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Storm application is designed as a topology of interfaces which create a "stream" of transformations. It provides similar functionality as a [[MapReduce]] job with the exception that it will theoretically run indefinitely until it is manually terminated.

Storm is used by many companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powered By Storm|url=https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/wiki/Powered-By|publisher=Github|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

Storm is developed under the [[Eclipse Public License]], making it available to most companies to use. Github is used for version control and issue tracking.
