'''Simpy''' was a web-based personal and [[social bookmarking]] service.  

The service launched in May 2004. In 2010, it was acquired by [[Reuters]] and ceased operation as a social bookmarking site in April of that year.

== Service features ==
Simpy used tags and [[tag cloud]]s to aid [[Internet bookmark|bookmark]] recall and allows bookmarks to be shared or kept private. In addition to saving, tagging, and sharing links, users could also save, tag, and search free-text notes. Most data pages also had [[RSS|RSS feeds]]. Simpy's founder is one of the developers of [[Lucene]], a popular text search toolkit, thus Simpy had powerful search capabilities. 

The service allowed for cooperation, via groups with different levels of privacy, and for discovery of relevant and new links via its watchlists and watchlist filters. 

Simpy had a well-documented [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] [[API]] suitable for [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]s and integration with other applications and services.

==de.lirio.us user migration to Simpy==
de.lirio.us was an [[open source]] clone of del.icio.us (criticized for its direct copying&lt;ref&gt;[http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2005/03/28/delirious-or-how-not-to-clone-a-service/ del.irio.us criticized at redmonk.com]&lt;/ref&gt;). It had technical problems and in March 2006, its maintainer announced that Simpy would take over the de.lirio.us userbase. The transfer to Simpy was completed in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.simpy.com/blojsom/blog/news/2006/06/13/De-lirio-us-Migrates-to-Simpy.html Transfer from de.lirio.us to Simpy]&lt;/ref&gt;
