'''dotCMS''' is a [[free software]] / [[open-source software|open source]] [[web content management system]] (wCMS) for building/managing [[website]]s, content and content driven web applications. dotCMS includes features such as support for [[virtual hosting]], [[WebDav]], [[structured content]], [[cluster (computing)|cluster]]ing and can run on multiple databases [[PostgreSQL]], [[MySQL]], [[MSSQL]] and [[Oracle Database|Oracle]]. It also includes standard wCMS features like page [[cache (computing)|caching]], templating, and an [[Application programming interface|API]]. There are a number of features and modules in dotCMS, including [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds, [[AJAX]] calendar, a reporting engine, news listing, [[blog]]s, forums, user tracking and [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]], built in search engine and [[internationalization and localization|language internationalization]] to name a few.

==History==
dotCMS was initially developed as a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] alternative to the [[PHP]] CMSes on the market, as well as to provide a counterpoint to high cost, enterprise applications. It is the result of over 5 years of development by dotMarketing, Inc, which also developed and released the open source project management tool [[dotProject]]. Both dotCMS and dotProject were conceived and originated by William Ezell. In order to achieve compliance with [[JSR-168]] [[portlet]] specification dotCMS was built upon the [[Liferay]] portal, though has since forked Liferay at version 3.2.2. dotCMS 1.0 was initially open sourced and made available in 2005 under the dotMarketing Public License. In 2006, dotCMS released version 1.2 which included the [[structured content]] engine. In 2007 dotCMS released version 1.5, which included a new user interface and permissions. In October, 2007 dotCMS 1.5 was the runner up for [[Packt Publishing]]'s "Best New Open Source CMS" award, followed in 2008 by a second place finish for Packt's "Best Other Open Source CMS (best non PHP CMS)". dotCMS was runner-up in the 2009 Packt Publishing category, "Best Other Open Source CMS." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.packtpub.com/article/best-other-open-source-cms-award-final-dotcms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies==
dotCMS is a CMS written in the [[Java (software platform)|Java]] programming language, and comes bundled with the [[Apache Tomcat]] Application Server. The freely available community edition can run on [[PostgreSQL]] and [[MySQL]] and paid for versions can run on [[MSSQL]] and [[Oracle Database|Oracle]].&lt;ref&gt;List of licensing options from dotcms [http://dotcms.com/products/editions/].&lt;/ref&gt; It is capable of integrating with user's authentication schemes, such as [[Active Directory]] or [[LDAP]], and will support operation in a clustered or [[Load balancing (computing)|load balanced]] environment. It leverages a number of open source projects such as:
*[[Apache Struts]] Web Framework
*Apache [[Lucene]] Search Engine
*[[Apache Velocity]] Templating Language
*[[Liferay]] Portal
*[[Dojo Toolkit|Dojo]] Javascript Framework
*[[Apache Tomcat]] Application Server
*[[JBoss Cache]] distributed caching system
*[[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]] Object Relational Mapping

===Structured Content===
The driving concept behind content stored within dotCMS is that it is addressed through a system of structures. Structures are administrated through a back end portlet where fields are assigned to them. Fields are named and given a content type and then ordered. Each structure can then be permissioned and used when creating content, and allows different types of content with consistent components to be referenced for display on the front end. A "web page content" structure could be assigned a title and body, for instance, while "events" have titles, dates, times, locations, descriptions, links, etc. Structures therefore allow the CMS to tailor itself to the content demands of the institution using it, because they can create and define structures that are specific to their needs. Those structures can then be created through relationships, allowing content from one structure to be associated content items in another. There is no limit to the number of structures one can use within dotCMS.
