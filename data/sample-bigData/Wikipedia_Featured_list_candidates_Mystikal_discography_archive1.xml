I am nominating this for featured list because I have worked extensively on it to ensure that it meets the criteria for a featured list, which I have based on the previous discographies I've worked on. Any criticism would be welcome if it improves the page.

*I've gone through the article and the tables are really well formatted, look very clear and concise. References looks good also. There are no dablink problems but there are [http://toolserver.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/webchecklinks.py?page=Mystikal_discography two dead links]. Pending this issue is resolved I will support the proposal of this list.

:I've fixed the charts.de link, but the Vevo link (see it yourself [http://www.vevo.com/artist/mystikal?source=lucenesearch here]) seems to actually be live even though Toolserver is labelling it as dead.

*Lead and infobox disagree with each other.
*Third sentence (starting with "Following his...") has too many run-on clauses...
*"in the top 5 of " top five.
*"After Mystikal began serving a prison " maybe "While Mystikal served a prison..."?
*"so far " need a timeframe for that.
*Where are the release dates referenced and which country/countries are they relevant to?
*Use a better link for the Kiss of the Dragon link, e.g. [[Kiss of the Dragon#Soundtrack]].
*Allmusic-&gt;AllMusic.

*"Mystikal's following two studio albums, ''Unpredictable'' and ''Ghetto Fabulous'', were both released on the record label No Limit Records (Jive distributed the album rather than No Limit's parent label, Priority Records) and both peaked in the top five of the ''Billboard'' 200 and were later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)."
:A run-on is present in this sentence. Perhaps a change to:
:"Mystikal's following two studio albums, ''Unpredictable'' and ''Ghetto Fabulous'', were both released on the record label No Limit Records; Jive distributed the album rather than No Limit's parent label, Priority Records. Both peaked in the top five of the ''Billboard'' 200 and were later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)."
*"It peaked at 37" → "It peaked at number 37"
*Since ''Mystikal'' is still a studio album, perhaps make the independent albums section a subsection of the studio albums section.
**Table caption for the "Independent albums" section could be made more specific: "List of independent albums, with some notes" → "List of independent studio albums, with some notes".

*Any reason why "Original" has a source in the singles section? It has charted, after all.
*No need to capitalize "The" in "The Netherlands".
*No need to italicize "[Original Soundtrack]" in the AllMusic reference for "The Edge of the Blade".
*Piped link for "Bubbling Under R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles" should point to "[[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs#Bubbling Under R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles]]".
