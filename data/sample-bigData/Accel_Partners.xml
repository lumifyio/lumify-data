==History==

Accel Partners was founded in 1983 by Arthur Patterson and Jim Swartz.

In 2000, Accel entered into a joint-venture with [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] to form [[Accel-KKR]] a technology-focused private equity investment firm focused on control investments of middle-market companies.

In addition to Accel's continued investments in early-stage startups from the Accel X early stage fund, Accel announced its $480 million growth fund in December of 2008. This fund has focused on growth equity opportunities across a broad range of sectors, including: information technology, internet, digital media, mobile, networking, software, and services. As with Accel's early-stage efforts, Accel Growth Fund has played an active role in helping entrepreneurs and management teams build category-defining, global businesses.

In April 2009, Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, formerly [[Google]]'s President for Asia-Pacific &amp; Latin American Operations, came on board as CEO-in-residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Accel Partners |title=Accel Partners Adds Google Executive Sukhinder Singh Cassidy as CEO-in-Residence |date=8 April 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
