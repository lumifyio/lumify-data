'''NEPOMUK''' (Networked Environment for Personal, [[Ontology]]-based Management of Unified Knowledge) is an open-source software specification that is concerned with the development of a social [[semantic desktop]] that enriches and interconnects data from different desktop applications using semantic [[metadata]] stored as [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]. Initially, it was developed in the NEPOMUK project&lt;ref&gt;[http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/ NEPOMUK - The Social Semantic Desktop]&lt;/ref&gt; and cost 17 million euros, of which 11.5 million was funded by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=PROJ_ICT&amp;ACTION=D&amp;DOC=1&amp;CAT=PROJ&amp;QUERY=011ca2def8a7:ccd3:321e9807&amp;RCN=79390 Cordis.europa.eu official page about the Nepomuk project]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementations ==
Three active implementations of NEPOMUK exist: A [[C++]]/[[KDE]]-based variant, a [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based variant, and a commercial version. More versions were created during the EU project between 2006 and 2008, some active beyond the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnowsis.com/about/blog/2010/11/20/how-does-gnowsis-relate-nepomuk-and-others How Does Gnowsis Relate to NEPOMUK and Others?] Blogpost dated 20.11.2010. Written by Leo Sauermann who contributed to the NEPOMUK project. 6 implementations of NEPOMUK are listed&lt;/ref&gt;

=== KDE ===
''NEPOMUK-KDE'' is featured as one of the newer technologies in [[KDE Software Compilation 4|KDE SC 4]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nepomuk.kde.org/ NEPOMUK-KDE project]&lt;/ref&gt; It uses [[Soprano (KDE)|Soprano]] as the main RDF data storage and parsing library, while ontology imports are handled through the [[Redland_RDF_Application_Framework|Raptor parser plugin]] and the [[Redland_RDF_Application_Framework|Redland storage plugin]], and all RDF data is stored in [[OpenLink_Software|OpenLink]] [[Virtuoso_Universal_Server|Virtuoso]], which also handles full-text indexing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trueg.wordpress.com/2011/09/22/about-strigi-soprano-virtuoso-clucene-and-libstreamanalyzer/ About Strigi, Soprano, Virtuoso, CLucene, and Libstreamanalyzer]&lt;/ref&gt; On a technical level, NEPOMUK-KDE allows associating metadata to various items present on a normal user's desktop such as files, bookmarks, e-mails, and calendar entries. Metadata can be arbitrary RDF; as of KDE 4, tagging is the most user-visible metadata application.

=== Zeitgeist ===
The [[Zeitgeist (framework)|Zeitgeist]] framework, used by [[GNOME]] and Ubuntu's [[Unity (user interface)|Unity user interface]], uses the NEPOMUK ontology, as does the [[MetaTracker|Tracker]] search engine.

=== Java ===
The Java-based implementation of NEPOMUK&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/ NEPOMUK-Java project]&lt;/ref&gt; was finished at the end of 2008 and served as a proof-of-concept environment for several novel semantic desktop techniques. It features its own frontend (''PSEW'') that integrates search, browsing, recommendation, and peer-to-peer functionality. The Java implementation uses the [[Sesame (framework)|Sesame]] RDF store and the [http://aperture.sourceforge.net/ Aperture] framework for integrating with other desktop applications such as mail clients and browsers.

A number of artifacts have been created in the context of the Java research implementation:

=== Refinder by Gnowsis ===
Implementation of the commercial [[Software as a service]] product ''Refinder''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getrefinder.com Refinder] by [http://www.gnowsis.com Gnowsis]&lt;/ref&gt; started in 2009 and a limited beta-version is released in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futurezone.at/stories/1664740/ Refinder: Das n√§chste Level des Hyperlinks] Article in Futurezone by Jakob Steinschaden, 3.12.2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Refinder'' is developed by Gnowsis, a spin-off company of the [[German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence| German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)]]. DFKI was project lead in the NEPOMUK EU project.

''Refinder'' uses the same data formats as the other implementations, but using [[Software as a service]] instead of the desktop approach of the other implementations.

== Data formats ==
* PIMO &amp;mdash; the data format used for describing a Personal Information Model, describing Persons, Projects, Topics, Events, etc., also used in NEPOMUK-KDE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/11/01/pimo/ Personal Information Model (PIMO)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* NIE &amp;mdash; the NEPOMUK Information Element Ontology (and the associated ontologies NFO etc.), describing resources on a desktop (files, mails, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/nie/ NEPOMUK Information Element Ontology]&lt;/ref&gt;
