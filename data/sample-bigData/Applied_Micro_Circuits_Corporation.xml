'''Applied Micro Circuits Corporation''' (also known as '''AppliedMicro''' or '''AMCC''' or '''APM''') is a [[fabless semiconductor company]] designing [[Computer networking|network]] and [[Embedded processor|embedded]] [[Power Architecture]] (including a Power Architecture license), and server processor [[ARM architecture|ARM]] (including an ARMv8 license), [[Optical communication#Optical fiber communication|optical transport]] and [[Computer storage|storage]] solutions. They bought assets, [[intellectual property|IP]] and engineers concerning the [[PowerPC 400]] [[microprocessor]]s from [[IBM]] in 2004 for $227 million and they now market the processors under their own name. The deal also included access to IBM's [[System-on-a-chip|SoC]] design methodology and advanced [[CMOS]] [[Semiconductor fabrication|process technology]].

In 2009 AppliedMicro changed their branding from AMCC to AppliedMicro, but still retain the name "Applied Micro Circuits Corporation" officially.

In 2011, AppliedMicro became the first company to implement the ARMv8 architecture with its X-Gene Platform. In November 2012 at ARM TechCon, AppliedMicro demonstrated advanced web search capabilities and the ability to handle [[big data]] workloads in an [[Apache Hadoop]] software environment with the X-Gene Platform using FPGA emulation. A silicon implementation of X-Gene was first exhibited publicly in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMCC X-Gene 64-bit silicon spotted in the wild|url=http://semiaccurate.com/2013/06/05/amcc-x-gene-64-bit-silicon-spotted-in-the-wild/|publisher=SemiAccurate|quote=SemiAccurate has been waiting for one big thing before declaring ARM servers real and AMCC has just delivered that. If you have been waiting for ARM V8 silicon to arrive, may we present to you AMCC X-Gene silicon in the wild.|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AppliedMicro has a sponsor level membership of [[Power.org]] and is one of the original members.
AppliedMicro is also executive member (Chairman position) of the [[Ethernet Alliance]].
AppliedMicro is also a member of the [[Open Compute Project]].

== Business Groups ==
=== Processor Products===

The Processor Products group designs and markets embedded microcontrollers as well as server processor, packet and storage processors. It includes the network processors of former MMC Networks (acquired October 2000) with IBM [[PowerPC]] 4xx series microcontrollers (acquired April 2004).

Since purchasing the IBM PowerPC 400 family (under the 405 and 440 series product names), AppliedMicro has developed the 460 series with 440 CPU, and a multicore Power architecture devices.

In January 2008, the AppliedMicro PowerPC 405EX was awarded PRODUCT OF THE YEAR 2007, by Electronic Product Magazine.

Also in January 2008, AppliedMicro announced an extension of its relationship with IBM Semiconductor; IBM now incorporates the AppliedMicro PowerPC 4xx product line in its Semiconductor Solutions offering. Under this expanded relationship, AppliedMicro and IBMâ€™s Semiconductor Solutions sales forces both market AppliedMicro's PowerPC 4xx products. AppliedMicro has added customers like Accusys and Qlogic to its large customer base for its PowerPC product line.

In October 2011, AppliedMicro announced its X-Gene Platform, an ARM 64-bit solution aimed at cloud and enterprise [[servers (computing)]].

=== Connectivity Products Group===

The Connectivity Products group of AppliedMicro designs, manufacturers and markets physical layer devices, framers/mappers and switch fabric devices. AppliedMicro has also a strong 10Gbit/s Physical layer devices portfolio and currently leads the 10GBPS PHY market. AppliedMicro announced (01/29/2008)  PEMAQUID / S19258, a XAUI-to-XFI 10G LAN/WAN/OTN Framer/Mapper/PHY device for [[10 Gigabit Ethernet|10GbE]], 10G [[Fibre Channel]], WIS (OC-192/STM-64) and [[OTU2]] network applications. The PEMAQUID (S19258) represents AppliedMicro's first device in its MEtrON (Metro Ethernet Optical Networks) product family that is designed for Metro Ethernet and Carrier Grade Ethernet solutions systems. PEMAQUID enables cost-effective Carrier Ethernet solutions for the Metro WDM Transport Network.

== Acquisitions ==

Throughout the years, AppliedMicro has acquired smaller companies to enter new markets.
