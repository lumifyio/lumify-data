      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''collective operation''' is a concept in [[parallel computing]] in which data is simultaneously sent to or received from many nodes. 

Common examples of collective operations are gather (in which data is collected from all nodes), scatter (in which a set of data is broken up into pieces, and a different piece is sent to all nodes), and broadcast (in which the same data is sent to all nodes). 

==Parallel computing frameworks with collective operations==
Collective operations are present in the following parallel programming frameworks:

* Google's [[MapReduce]] framework
* [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/mpi-standard/mpi-report-2.0/node144.htm Intercommunicator Collective Operations]. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard, chapter 7.3.1. Mathematics and Computer Science Division, [[Argonne National Laboratory]].&lt;/ref&gt;
