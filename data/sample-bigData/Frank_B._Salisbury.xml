      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Frank B. Salisbury''' (born 1926) is an American plant physiologist who served for a time as head of the [[Utah State University]] (USU) department of Plant science.

Salisbury has a BS and MA from the [[University of Utah]].  He received his Ph.D. from the [[California Institute of Technology]].  He taught for eleven years as a professor at [[Colorado State University]] before joining the faculty of USU.

Salisbury wrote the best-selling textbook ''Plant Physiology'' with [[Cleon W. Ross]] and edited ''Geochemistry and the Biosphere'' with V. I. Vernadskii.

A member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], Salisbury argues that there is evidence of God having created life. He has written extensively on the subject and one of his more recent works is entitled ''Case for Divine Design''.
