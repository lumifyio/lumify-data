'''Fluidinfo''', formerly named FluidDB until early 2011, is an online [[Cloud computing|cloud]] data store based on an [[Attribute-value system|attribute-value centric]] data model.&lt;ref&gt;"New Approaches to Information Management: Attribute-Centric Data Systems", '''R. Baeza-Yates, T. Jones, and G. Rawlins'''. ''SPIRE 2000'' pp. 17-27 [http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/SPIRE.2000.878176]&lt;/ref&gt; Fluidinfo is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and characterized by a publicly writeable schema-less database that provides a  query language, a fine-grained permissions model and promotes data sharing, both publicly and in groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc.fluidinfo.com/fluidDB/overview.html Fluidinfo information overview]&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of an underlying [[RDBMS]] structure may classify Fluidinfo as a type of publicly writeable "collective database".&lt;ref&gt;"Data Control Made Easy", '''Jose Garcia'''. ''O'Reilly Media''. Retrieved on 2010-11-07.[http://www.oreillygmt.eu/open-sourcefree-software/data-control-made-easy-with-fluiddb/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"10 Ways Data Is Changing How We Live", '''Conrad Quilty-Harper'''. ''Telegraph.co.uk''. Retrieved on 2010-11-08.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/7963311/10-ways-data-is-changing-how-we-live.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Few data stores are available with the intent to provide public write-access, except in narrow contexts. Two examples of shareable data stores operating in specific contexts are [[Delicious (website)|del.icio.us]] (shareable [[Social bookmarking|bookmarks]]) and [[Twitter]] (micro-blogging service). Fluidinfo offers a generalized shareable data store, where potentially any piece or type of information can be shared with anybody else, if desired, striving for a balance between individual, group and communal data ownership. Author and blogger [[Robert Scoble]] described Fluidinfo as a "database that acts like a wiki".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Scoble video interview with Terry Jones. Retrieved on 2009-09-18. [http://scobleizer.com/2008/12/05/the-unfundable-world-changing-startup]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluidinfo emphasizes three aspects that make it unique among existing public data stores:
* Data model
* Query language
* Permissions

=== Data Model ===
The data model aims to be as flexible as possible, permitting a wide range of information to be stored in Fluidinfo. The fundamental difference between [[Attribute-value system|attribute-value]] stores (along the lines of [[Entity-attribute-value model|EAV]] schemas) and traditional [[RDBMS]] is the lack of a highly-defined top-down structure. The essence of Fluidinfo consists of arbitrary objects, which can be considered points in a data space to which [[Tag (metadata)|tags]] may be attached. Objects have no owners, similar to concepts in the "real" world. Tags are initially controlled by the user/application who creates them and can be attached to objects, in a fashion reminiscent of how humans use their minds to create and associate information with physical objects or
concepts. One of the underlying motivations of Fluidinfo is to make working with information more natural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc.fluidinfo.com/fluidDB/overview.html Fluidinfo information overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can attach tags to any data object, but only people with the right [[Role (computer science)|roles]] can see and search these tags.&lt;ref&gt;"FluidDB review", '''Peter Wayner'''. ''TechWorld.com''. Retrieved on 2010-11-04.[http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/05/fluiddb-backing.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Query Language ===
The [[query language]] was designed to perform complex queries in as simple a manner as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.fluidinfo.com/fluidDB/2009/09/10/the-myriad-benefits-of-a-simple-query-language Fluidinfo query language description]&lt;/ref&gt; The syntax is superficially reminiscent of [[information retrieval]] query languages such as [[Contextual Query Language|CQL]] which are characterized as less complicated than traditional database query languages such as [[SQL]]. The query language always return object identifiers based on tag values, using the predicates below:&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc.fluidinfo.com/fluidDB/queries.html Fluidinfo query language documentation]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Numeric''': To find objects based on the numeric value of tags; e.g. &lt;code&gt;tim/rating &gt; 5&lt;/code&gt;
* '''Textual''': To find objects based on text matching of their tag values; e.g. &lt;code&gt;sally/opinion matches fantastic&lt;/code&gt;
* '''Presence''': Use has to request objects that have a given tag; e.g. &lt;code&gt;has sally/opinion&lt;/code&gt;
* '''Set contents''': A tag on an object can hold a set of strings. For example, a tag called &lt;code&gt;mary/product-reviews/keywords&lt;/code&gt; might be on an object with a value of &lt;code&gt;[ "cool", "kids", "adventure" ]&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;contains&lt;/code&gt; operator can be used to select objects with a matching value. The query &lt;code&gt;mary/product-reviews/keywords contains "kids"&lt;/code&gt; would match the object in this example.
* '''Exclusion''': You can exclude objects with the &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; keyword. For example &lt;code&gt;has nytimes.com/appeared except has james/seen&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; operator performs a set difference.
* '''Logic''': Query components can be combined with &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;. For example &lt;code&gt;has sara/rating and tim/rating &gt; 5&lt;/code&gt;.
* '''Grouping''': Parentheses can be used to group query components. For example &lt;code&gt;has sara/rating and (tim/rating &gt; 5 or mike/rating &gt; 7)&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Permissions ===
For each action that be applied to any tag or namespace within Fluidinfo, there is:
* A policy (either 'open' or 'closed'); and
* A (possibly empty) list of exceptions to the policy.

The various actions that can be performed on a tag are &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;see&lt;/code&gt;. The combination of the various actions with policies and exceptions provides a fine-grained permission model within Fluidinfo. It should be re-emphasized that only tags and namespaces have permissions allowing for various levels of control. Objects (the basic Fluidinfo data structure) do not have owners and so cannot be controlled by users/applications.

Examples of the permission model in various states are shown in the table below:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/terrycojones/introducing-fluiddb Slideshare FluidDB presentation, pp. 68-69]&lt;/ref&gt;
