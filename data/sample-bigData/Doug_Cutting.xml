'''Douglass Read Cutting''' is an advocate and creator of [[open-source]] search technology. He originated [[Lucene]] and, with [[Mike Cafarella]], [[Nutch]], both open-source search technology projects which are now managed through the [[Apache Software Foundation]]. He is also the creator of [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]].

==Education and early career==
He holds a bachelor's degree from Stanford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cloudera.com/company/management/ |title=Cloudera Management |publisher=Cloudera |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to developing Lucene, Doug held search technology positions at [[Excite]], [[Apple Inc.]] and [[Xerox PARC]].

==Open-source projects==
[[Lucene]], a search indexer, and [[Nutch]], a spider or crawler, are the two key components of an open-source general search platform, which first crawls the Web for content, and then structures it into a searchable index. Cutting's leadership of these two projects extended the concepts and capabilities of general open-source software projects such as [[Linux]] and [[MySQL]] into the important vertical domain {{Clarify|date=January 2012}} of search. While it is difficult to track the total number of installations of these platforms, public announcements of the use of [[Lucene]] and its direct descendant [[Solr]] by various venture-backed startups indicate a significant level of adoption. Perhaps the most significant deployment of [[Lucene]] is [[Wikipedia]], where it powers search for the entire site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Use of MapReduce paradigm==
In December 2004, [[Google]] Labs published a paper on the [[MapReduce]] algorithm, which allows very large scale computations to be trivially parallelized across large clusters of servers. Cutting, realizing the importance of this paper to extending [[Lucene]] into the realm of extremely large (web-scale) search problems, created the open-source [[Hadoop]] [[Software framework|framework]] that allows applications based on the [[MapReduce]] paradigm to be run on large clusters of commodity hardware. Cutting was an employee of [[Yahoo!]], where he led the [[Hadoop]] project full-time; he has since moved on to [[Cloudera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdtimes.com/blog/post/2009/08/10/Hadoop-creator-goes-to-Cloudera.aspx |title=Hadoop creator goes to Cloudera |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |author=Handy, Alex |publisher=Software Development Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Doug Cutting was elected to the board of directors of the Apache Software Foundation, and in September 2010, he was elected its chairman.
