        <div id="presentationContent" class="plain">
            <p>Chairman Feinstein, Co-Chairman Grassley, and distinguished members of the  caucus, on behalf of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Acting Administrator  Michele Leonhart and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Robert S.  Mueller, III, we appreciate your invitation to testify today regarding violence  in Mexico and its implications for the United States. The Department of Justice  law enforcement agencies have outstanding relationships with law enforcement  agencies on both sides of the border. With the assistance of our counterparts,  the Department strives to coordinate investigative activity and develop  intelligence in order to efficiently and effectively manage law enforcement  efforts with the goal of identifying, infiltrating, and dismantling drug  trafficking organizations that are directly responsible for the violence in  Mexico.</p>
<p>The DEA, in conjunction with the FBI, has been at the forefront of U.S.  efforts to work with foreign law enforcement counterparts in confronting the  organizations that profit from the global drug trade. The Department recognizes  that in order to effectively attack the international drug trade it has to  forward deploy its personnel into the foreign arena. DEA has the largest federal  law enforcement presence overseas. DEA has 83 offices in 62 countries and works  with host governments in assessing drug threats, gathering intelligence,  targeting major drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), and, in coordination with  the Department of State, assisting host governments in developing comprehensive  counternarcotics strategies. The FBI has a legal attaché office in Mexico City  which works closely with counterparts, shares intelligence, and coordinates  international investigations. In addition, the FBI has Border Liaison Officers  who travel to Mexico on a weekly basis to coordinate with law enforcement  partners.</p>
<p><b>The Southwest Border</b></p>
<p>The Southwest border (SWB) of the United States is the principal arrival zone  for most of the illicit drugs smuggled into the United States, as well as the  predominant staging area for the drugs’ subsequent distribution throughout the  country. According to El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) drug seizure data, most  of the cocaine, foreign-source marijuana and methamphetamine, and Mexican-source  heroin available in the United States is smuggled into the country across the  SWB. The SWB is particularly vulnerable to drug smuggling because of the  enormous volume of people and goods legitimately crossing the border between the  two countries every day. Moreover, large sections of the nearly 2,000-mile land  border between Mexico and the United States are both vast and remote, and this  provides additional smuggling opportunities for Mexican DTOs. Once at the  border, Mexican traffickers use every method imaginable to smuggle drugs into  this country including aircraft, backpackers, couriers, horses and mules,  maritime vessels, rail, tunnels, and vehicles.</p>
<p>In response, the DEA and FBI, in cooperation with U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other  federal, state, local, and foreign counterparts, are attacking these  organizations at all levels. The disruption and dismantlement of these  organizations, the denial of proceeds, and the seizure of assets significantly  impacts the DTOs’ ability to exercise influence and to further destabilize the  region. Key to DEA and FBI operational success is the collection and sharing of  intelligence, which is made possible and enhanced through EPIC, DEA’s Special  Operations Division (SOD), the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force  (OCDETF) Fusion Center, and DEA’s and FBI’s participation in the intelligence  community. In short, guided by intelligence, DEA and the FBI are working  diligently on both sides of the border to stem the flow of illicit drugs and  assist the government of Mexico (GOM) in breaking the power and impunity of the  drug cartels.</p>
<p><b>The Scope of Drug Trafficking on the Southwest Border</b></p>
<p>Prior to addressing Mexico’s security situation, it is important to have a  clear picture of the illicit drug-trafficking industry within Mexico as it  relates to the United States. No other country in the world has a greater impact  on the drug situation in the United States than does Mexico. The influence of  Mexico on the U.S. drug trade is truly unmatched: the result of a shared border;  Mexico’s strategic location between drug-producing and drug-consuming countries;  a long history of cross-border smuggling; and the existence of diversified,  poly-drug, profit-minded DTOs. Each of the four major drugs of abuse—marijuana,  cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine—are either produced in, or transshipped  through, Mexico before reaching the United States. The vast majority of bulk  currency interdicted within the U.S. is derived from drug trafficking  activities. It is estimated that approximately 18-39 billion dollars annually is  moved from the interior of the U.S. to the Southwest border on behalf of Mexican  and Colombian DTOs. Thus, billions of U.S. dollars are sent back to Mexico  annually. From the Mexican perspective, the flow of vast sums of money engenders  corruption. The strategic consequence of the continuous seeping of illicit  proceeds into the Mexican economy discourages the long-term growth of—indeed  even the incentive to sustain—legitimate businesses and institutions. For all of  these reasons, the U.S. and Mexican governments share the responsibility to  defeat the threat of drug-trafficking.</p>
<p><b><i>Heroin:</i></b> Mexico is an opium  poppy-cultivating/heroin-producing country. While Mexico accounts for only about  6 percent of the world’s opium poppy cultivation and heroin production, it is a  major supplier of heroin to abusers in the United States, particularly in  regions west of the Mississippi River. It has been alarming to note that Mexican  black tar and brown heroin has appeared increasingly in eastern-U.S. drug  markets over the past several years. According to DEA’s Heroin Signature Program  (HSP), Mexico was identified as the source country for 39 percent of the samples  classified under the HSP during 2008, the largest representation of  Mexican-source heroin in the United States in the past 20 years. We assess with  high confidence that Mexican cartels are seeking to maximize revenues from an  industry that they control from production through distribution.</p>
<p><b><i>Marijuana:</i></b> Mexico is the number one foreign  supplier of marijuana abused in the United States. In fact, according to a 2008  inter-agency report, marijuana is the top revenue generator for Mexican DTOs—a  cash crop that finances corruption and the carnage of violence year after year.  The profits derived from marijuana trafficking—an industry with minimal overhead  costs, controlled entirely by the traffickers—are used not only to finance other  drug enterprises by Mexico’s poly-drug cartels, but also to pay recurring  “business” expenses, purchase weapons, and bribe corrupt officials. Though the  GOM has a robust eradication program, many of the military personnel  traditionally assigned to eradicate marijuana and opium poppy have recently been  diverted to the offensive against the cartels.</p>
<p><b><i>Methamphetamine: </i></b>Mexico is also the number-one  foreign supplier of methamphetamine to the United States. Although the Mexican  government has made enormous strides in controlling—even banning—the importation  of methamphetamine precursor chemicals such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and  phenyl acetic acid, Mexican methamphetamine-producing and trafficking  organizations are proving to be extremely resourceful in circumventing the  strict regulatory measures put in place by the Calderon Administration. As with  heroin, there is considerable financial incentive for the Mexican DTOs to  sustain a trade they control from manufacture to distribution and, in fact,  Mexican authorities seized more methamphetamine labs in 2009—210—than in the  five previous years combined.</p>
<p><b><i>Cocaine:</i></b> Mexico’s importance in the cocaine trade  cannot be overstated. Since the 1980s, Mexico has served as a primary  transportation corridor for cocaine destined for the United States. While Mexico  is not a coca-producing country and therefore cannot control the trade from  beginning to end, traffickers in Mexico have managed nonetheless to exert  increasing control over the trade in exchange for shouldering the greater risk  inherent in transporting the cocaine and ensuring its distribution in the United  States. In recent years, Mexican trafficking organizations have extended their  reach deep into South America to augment—or personally facilitate—cooperation  with Colombian sources of supply, or to develop relationships with alternate  sources of supply in other cocaine-producing countries, particularly Peru.  Demonstrating an even further reach into global cocaine markets, Mexican drug  traffickers have evolved into intermediate sources of supply for cocaine in  Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Middle East. More important for our discussion  today, Mexican DTOs dominate the wholesale distribution of cocaine and other  drugs of abuse throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>Current estimates suggest that approximately 93 percent of the cocaine  leaving South America for the United States moves through Mexico. In just the  past year, however, more cocaine—about 60 percent of the 90 percent, according  to inter-agency estimates—stops first in a Central American country, before  onward shipment to Mexico, than at any time since the inter-agency began  tracking cocaine movement. This trend suggests that the Calderon  Administration’s initiatives, particularly those related to port security and  the tracking of suspicious aircraft, are having an impact on how the cartels do  business, requiring them to take the extra—and ostensibly more costly and  vulnerable—step of arranging multi-stage transportation systems.</p>
<p>Changes in cocaine movement patterns are not the only measurable trend.  Beginning in January of 2007—immediately after the Calderon government was  installed—the price per gram of cocaine in the United States began to rise, with  a correlative drop in cocaine purity. We are now in a 36-month sustained period  of declining purity and increasing price in nearly every major cocaine market in  the United States. During this period, we have seen prices increase by almost 72  percent and purity fall by nearly 33 percent.</p>
<p><b>Violence in Mexico: Statistics and Causes</b></p>
<p>While it may seem counterintuitive, the extraordinary level of violence in  Mexico is another signpost of successful law-and-order campaigns by military and  law enforcement officials in Mexico. The violence in Mexico can be organized  into three broad categories: intra-cartel violence that occurs among and between  members of the same criminal syndicate, inter-cartel violence that occurs  between rival groups, and cartel-versus-government violence. It is important to  note that intra- and inter-cartel violence have always been associated with the  Mexican drug trade. DEA and FBI assesses that the current surge in violence is  driven in large measure by the GOM’s proactive actions against the traffickers,  along with other variables, such as cartel on cartel violence.</p>
<p>The drug trade in Mexico has been rife with violence for decades, though the  level and the severity of violence we are seeing today is unprecedented. Without  minimizing the severity of the problems we are confronted with today, it is  nonetheless critical to understand the background of the “culture of violence”  associated with Mexican DTOs and the cyclical nature of the “violence epidemics”  with which Mexico is periodically beset. We do not have to go very far back in  history to recall the cross-border killing spree engaged in by Los Zetas  operatives in the Laredo-Nuevo Laredo area during 2004-05. But one thing must  remain clear in any discussion of violence in Mexico, or violence practiced by  Mexican traffickers operating in the United States: drug gangs are inherently  violent, and nowhere is this more true than in Mexico, where Wild West-style  shootouts between the criminals and the cops, and/or elements of opposing  trafficking groups is far too common. Since 2007, there have been over 22,000  drug-related murders in Mexico, as reported by the Mexican Attorney General’s  Office.</p>
<p>We cringe at news stories detailing the arrest of a “pozolero” (stew-maker),  a killer who disposes of his victims’ body parts in barrels of acid, or the  discovery of a mass grave containing the remains of countless victims  decomposing under a layer of lime. But these and other gruesome tactics are not  new. What is both new and disturbing are the sustained efforts of Mexican DTOs  to use violence as a tool to undermine public support for the government’s  counter-drug efforts. Traffickers have made a concerted effort to send a public  message through their bloody campaign of violence. They now often resort to  leaving the beheaded and mutilated bodies of their tortured victims out for  public display with the intent of intimidating government officials and the  public alike.</p>
<p>Particularly worrisome are those tactics intended to intimidate police and  public officials, and law-abiding citizens. The intimidation of public and  police officials through violence or the threat of violence has a more insidious  side. Not all corruption is a clear cut, money-for-cooperation, negotiation: the  intimidation of officials, threats against their lives or their families’ lives,  is a much more widespread and effective tactic, and likely accounts for a  plurality of corrupt law enforcement officials in Mexico.</p>
<p>Murder is not solely a coercive strategy on the part of the cartels. The  murders are acts of desperation. Operational successes by the military and law  enforcement, and massive reforms being undertaken by the judiciary, have  provided the catalyst for much of the violence. The deployment of tens of  thousands of military troops—mobilized specifically to confront DTOs in “hot  spots” throughout the country—along with concerted law enforcement operations  targeting specific cartel members or specific import/export hubs, have disrupted  supply routes both into and out of Mexico, and have shattered alliances. Entry  ports for large maritime shipments of cocaine from South America, previously  wholly controlled by the cartels through corruption, intimidation, and force,  are instead patrolled and inspected by vetted members of Mexico’s armed forces.  The lucrative transportation corridors within Mexico and into the United States,  once incontestably held by cartel “gatekeepers” and “plaza bosses,” are now  riddled with military checkpoints and monitored by Mexican law enforcement.</p>
<p>Disrupted supply routes translate to intense competition between the drug  trafficking organizations who control still-viable routes, and those who want to  control them. These stressors are further compounded by shifting alliances,  long-standing feuds, and record-breaking seizures by the GOM. Challenging the  status quo and holding the traffickers accountable demonstrates the resolve of  President Calderon’s government. Successfully transforming the situation from  one that represents a serious threat to the national security of both Mexico and  the U.S. to a problem that can effectively be dealt with as a traditional  criminal justice problem will require considerably more work, particularly with  regard to institutional reform and anticorruption efforts. Fortunately,  President Calderon has already committed to these reforms, both in rhetoric and  in action.</p>
<p><b>Spillover Violence</b></p>
<p>Excessive violence by the cartels is a national security problem for Mexico,  and—as our close neighbor and political ally—presents high stakes for the United  States. In the past year, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies have  worked diligently to reach a consensus view on “spillover” violence and on U.S.  vulnerability to the Mexican cartels’ violent tactics. These discussions  required the interagency to define “spillover” in practical terms. As agreed to  by the interagency community, spillover violence entails deliberate, planned  attacks by the cartels on U.S. assets, including civilian, military, or law  enforcement officials, innocent U.S. citizens, or physical institutions such as  government buildings, consulates, or businesses. This definition does not  include trafficker on trafficker violence, whether perpetrated in Mexico or the  U.S.</p>
<p>Spillover violence is a complicated issue. It is crucial, in order to address  the problem with the appropriate programs, resources, and operations, that we  understand the difference between the intentional targeting of innocent  civilians in the United States, or official U.S. government interests in Mexico  or the United States, and actions that are characteristic of violent drug  culture, such as the killing of an individual who owes a drug debt to the  organization. Certain isolated incidents in the United States, such as the  torture by a Mexican trafficker of a Dominican drug customer in Atlanta, are  frightening, but do not represent a dramatic departure from the violence that  has always been associated with the drug trade.</p>
<p>Much of the risk of spillover violence is posed by younger-generation  traffickers whose approach to the drug trade is less rational and profit-minded  than that of their “elders,” or by multi-national street and prison gangs  working in concert with Mexican cartels as enforcers and street-level drug  distributors. As the GOM has continuously and successfully disrupted the  cartels’ command and control structure through operations against their leaders,  less-experienced “junior” cartel members are inhabiting roles formerly held by  traffickers of long standing who, while violent, tended to be more deliberate  and cautious in their actions. In Ciudad Juarez, where three individuals  associated with the U.S. consulate were killed in March, the Barrio Azteca (BA)  street gang is the best known of several gangs being used as enforcers by La  Linea, gatekeepers for the Juarez Cartel. The BA has been linked to drug  trafficking, prostitution, extortion, assaults, murder, and the retail sale of  drugs obtained by Mexican DTOs. Elsewhere in Mexico, the link between street  gangs and the Mexican cartels is more fluid and tenuous, with gang members  typically filling retail drug sales roles rather than providing enforcement.</p>
<p>Between March 18 and 21, the FBI and DEA led a collaborative effort of more  than 200 federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel in “Operation  Knockdown.” Through Operation Knockdown, interviews of over 350 Barrio Azteca  gang members in El Paso and New Mexico were conducted. The interviews focused on  the activities of drug hit squads in the Ciudad Juarez-El Paso corridor, with a  particular focus on gathering intelligence related to the March 13 murders of  three individuals associated with our consulate in Ciudad Juarez. The interviews  were also an attempt to generate information regarding the FBI Top Ten fugitive  and BA member Eduardo Ravelo’s possible location. Intelligence from Operation  Knockdown led to 54 arrests, and the seizure of various items of documentary  evidence. As a result of this heightened law enforcement pressure, officials are  gleaning actionable information directly from gang members.</p>
<p><b>Government of Mexico Initiatives</b></p>
<p>In the three years since Felipe Calderon assumed his post as President of  Mexico, he and his administration have acted with unprecedented vigor and  resolve against organized crime and its primary purveyors, the drug cartels.  With sustained efforts in attacking the insidious problems of drug-related  corruption and violence on every front, the Calderon Administration must be  credited at least partially with the sustained reduction in the availability of  cocaine in the United States.</p>
<p>Having deployed the military to replace state and local police in the most  violence-plagued areas of the country, President Calderon attacked the very core  of cartel power: the corruption of public officials. With narco-corruption cases  increasingly pointing to high-ranking federal officials in the Mexican  government, President Calderon launched Operation Limpieza (Clean Sweep).  Designed to improve operational integrity within several Mexican government  agencies, including the Attorney General’s Office (PGR), the Secretariat of  Public Security, and the military, Operation Limpieza has already resulted in  the arrests of dozens of corrupt public officials, and the drafting of a joint  GOM-U.S. Department of Justice proposal on police and judicial reforms.  Benchmark reforms include improvements in internal security processes (such as  background investigations, internal affairs/disciplinary actions, and ethics  training), information security processes (such as evidence handling and case  file management), and physical security processes (such as structural  improvements and access limitations).</p>
<p>The Southwest border is a particular focus of the Department’s  corruption-fighting efforts. Of the 700 FBI agents leading our charge against  public corruption, approximately 120 are working along the Southwest border. The  FBI coordinates its investigative efforts along the Southwest border with the  Department of Homeland Security - Office of Inspector General (DHS-OIG); U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Office of Professional Responsibility  (ICE-OPR); Customs and Border Protection- Internal Affairs (CBP-IA);  Transportation Security Administration (TSA); the DEA; and the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). As a result, over 400 public  corruption cases originate from that region. In fiscal year 2009, there were  over 100 arrests and over 130 state and federal cases prosecuted.</p>
<p>The FBI’s 12 border corruption task forces along the Southwest border share  information with the Southwest Intelligence Group (SWIG), EPIC, and Mexican  legal attachés to both identify and disrupt Mexican drug trafficking  organizations from utilizing and soliciting United States public officials to  commit criminal activities. The National Border Corruption Task Force (NCBTF)  has been established at FBI Headquarters. Consisting of representatives from the  FBI, DHS-OIG, ICE OPR, CBP-IA, and TSA, this task force ensures general guidance  and oversight of border corruption programs across the country. Internally, our  NCBTF is coordinating with other impacted divisions at FBI Headquarters. These  include the FBI’s Directorate of Intelligence, Counterintelligence Division,  Counterterrorism Division, and Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate. Through  trend analysis, intelligence and information sharing, and the utilization of  lessons learned and best practices, we are becoming more nimble in our approach  and making great strides. In addition, the GOM created the Special Organized  Crime Court (SOCC), which has jurisdiction over organized crime investigations  throughout the Republic of Mexico, and has three primary functions: 1) to  authorize the provisional detention of organized crime suspects; 2) to authorize  search warrants; and 3) to authorize the interception of communications for  evidentiary purposes. The SOCC has nationwide jurisdiction, which not only  eliminates the administrative inefficiencies of the previous system, but should  also resolve intimidation and corruption-related issues associated with the  previous requirement that prosecutors go to local judges in close proximity to  the suspected criminal activity.</p>
<p>In June 2008, President Calderon approved a Constitutional amendment  permitting the GOM’s transition from a written inquisitorial (confession-based)  justice system, to an oral adversarial (investigations-based) system. This  transition is a significant step toward improving transparency in legal  proceedings in Mexico and helps insure the integrity of the judicial  process.</p>
<p>The United States is engaged in cooperative efforts with Mexican law  enforcement to provide information, training, and equipment that will allow  Mexican authorities to investigate, capture, and prosecute members of Mexico’s  most dangerous and powerful drug cartels. The quantifiable impact of huge drug,  weapons, and money seizures presents an incomplete picture. While more difficult  to measure, the enormous psychological impact of high-level arrests and record  numbers of extraditions completes the picture. No other action by the GOM  strikes quite so deeply at cartel fears than an arrest and extradition.</p>
<p>Beginning only weeks after his inauguration, President Calderon began  extraditing high-profile criminals to the United States. In January 2007,  President Calderon took the politically courageous step of extraditing 15  individuals to stand trial in the United States, including notorious Gulf Cartel  head, Osiel Cardenas-Guillen who, just this past February, was sentenced to 25  years in prison. In fact, February 2010 was a landmark month. On February 19,  the GOM extradited Vicente Zambada-Niebla, son of kingpin Ismael “Mayo”  Zambada-Garcia and a leader in the Sinaloa Cartel. On February 25, Miguel  Caro-Quintero was sentenced to 17 years in a U.S. federal prison, after having  been extradited last January. Miguel Caro-Quintero had assumed control of the  family organization after the arrest of his brother Rafael Caro-Quintero, who  was complicit in the kidnapping, torture, and murder of DEA Special Agent  Enrique Camarena.</p>
<p>Since that day, the government of Mexico has extradited in excess of 280  criminals to the United States. These individuals are associated with some of  the most notorious Mexican drug trafficking organizations: the Sinaloa Cartel,  the Gulf Cartel, and the Arellano Felix Organization.</p>
<p>During the past year, the GOM has achieved unprecedented success in  apprehending high-value targets based in Mexico. For example, in March 2009, DEA  fugitive Vicente Zambada-Niebla, mentioned previously as a recently-extradited  leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, was arrested in Mexico City. In October 2009,  another Sinaloa Cartel leader and DEA fugitive, Oscar Nava-Valencia (known as  "El Lobo") was apprehended near Guadalajara, Mexico. Nava is currently  incarcerated in Mexico, pending extradition to the U.S. In December 2009, the  "Boss of Bosses" Arturo Beltran-Leyva was killed in Cuernavaca, Mexico during an  arrest operation after a two-hour gun battle with Mexican military forces.  Beltran was considered one of the most powerful drug lords in Mexico. And  finally, on January 12, 2010, DEA and the U.S. Marshals Service identified the  residence of one of Mexico’s most wanted fugitives and co-leader of the Tijuana  Cartel, Eduardo Garcia-Simental (known as “El Teo”), who was responsible for  many of the homicides, kidnappings, and tortures in Tijuana. El Teo’s brother,  Manuel, and their chief lieutenant Raydel Lopez-Uriarte, were arrested less than  one month later, on February 8. All these high-impact actions—seizures, arrests  and extraditions—serve to make one important point: drug traffickers are  inherently violent—but desperate, vulnerable drug traffickers operating under  unprecedented stress are exceedingly violent.</p>
<p><b>Interagency Initiatives Along the Southwest Border</b></p>
<p>DEA and the FBI are agencies with global reach who work vigorously with law  enforcement counterparts in both the United States and Mexico to address the  violence in Mexico through joint investigations and the sharing of intelligence.  We routinely collect and share intelligence pertaining to those violent drug  trafficking organizations and armed groups operating in and around “hot spots”  along the Southwest border. Additionally, DEA has the largest U.S. law  enforcement presence in Mexico with offices in Mexico City, Tijuana, Hermosillo,  Nogales, Ciudad Juarez, Mazatlan, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Matamoros, Nuevo  Laredo, and Merida. As of April 2010, DEA has 1,205 special agent positions  working in domestic offices with responsibilities for the SWB, representing  approximately 23 percent of DEA’s total special agent workforce. In addition,  DEA has the largest law enforcement presence of any U.S. agency in Mexico, with  62 special agents. Overall, some 24 percent of DEA’s total special agent  workforce is assigned to either Mexico or the Southwest border.</p>
<p>FBI Resolution Six (R-6) agents, co-located with DEA agents, coordinate drug  and gang investigations conducted in Mexico. They are also responsible for  supporting domestic cases for U.S. prosecution, cultivating liaison contacts  within Mexico, and supporting bilateral criminal enterprise initiatives. Working  closely with counterparts assigned to the Mexican Embassy, legal attachés, the  El Paso Intelligence Center, and the Southwest Intelligence Group as well as  with our federal partners in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, we leverage all available  resources and expertise. Our close coordination with impacted state and local  law enforcement and our Mexican counterparts allow us real-time access to  intelligence and information that in 2009, alone, enabled us to realize over 800  convictions related to Mexican DTOs.</p>
<p>As the lead U.S. law enforcement agency responsible for enforcing the drug  laws of the United States, DEA has been at the forefront of U.S. efforts to work  with foreign law enforcement counterparts in confronting the organizations that  profit from the global drug trade. DEA’s success is due, at least in part, to  its single-mission focus. DEA is well positioned to mount a sustained attack on  the command and control elements of drug trafficking organizations; however, DEA  does not operate in a vacuum. Rather, DEA and FBI, in conjunction with the  Department of Justice; the Department of Homeland Security; the Department of  Defense; the intelligence community; and state, local, other federal, and  foreign counterparts, mount a coordinated attack against all levels of the drug  trade with an aim at disrupting and dismantling the command and control elements  of these organizations.</p>
<p>Several noteworthy interagency efforts are being coordinated along the  SWB:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most recently, on June 5 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Attorney General  Holder, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Napolitano, and Office  of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director Kerlikowske released President  Obama’s <b><i>National</i></b> <b><i>Southwest Border  Counternarcotics Strategy</i>, </b>designed to stem the flow of illegal  drugs and their illicit proceeds across the Southwest Border and to reduce  associated crime and violence in the region. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b><i>SWB Initiative </i></b>is a multi-agency, federal law  enforcement operation that attacks Mexico-based DTOs operating along the SWB by  targeting the communication systems of their command and control centers. The  SWB Initiative has been in operation since 1994. As part of a cooperative  effort, DEA, the FBI, CBP, ICE, and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices around the country  conduct wiretaps that ultimately identify all levels of Mexico or Colombia-based  DTOs. This strategy allows tracking of the drugs as they flow from Colombia or  Mexico to the streets of the United States. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b><i>Southwest Border Intelligence Collection Plan (SWBICP) </i></b>was initiated by DEA in October 2009 to provide a regional  intelligence collection framework to support enforcement operations on the SWB  of the United States. The SWBICP provides operational, tactical, strategic, and  policy-level intelligence used to support investigations, regional planning, and  resource decision-making. Intelligence gathered under the guidance of the SWBICP  is shared with the intelligence community and other federal, state, and local  law enforcement agencies. The SWBICP also provides a mechanism to collect  information needed to assess counterdrug measures and security threats along the  U.S.-Mexico border. The SWBICP evolved from DEA’s previous highly-successful  SWB-focused intelligence collection plan, <b><i>Operation Black  Flag.</i></b> </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b><i>Concealment Trap Initiative (CTI) </i></b>targets  those vital service providers who build concealed trap compartments or use  natural voids in vehicles or other conveyances and residences for DTOs to  conceal bulk cash or other contraband. Drug traffickers recognize that “bulk”  currency is subject to seizure and easily forfeited when discovered by law  enforcement authorities. To counter this, drug traffickers employ a myriad of  techniques, including the use of concealment traps, to impede and frustrate law  enforcement’s efforts to discover and seize illicit drug proceeds. The CTI  addresses the challenge of helping law enforcement officers and agents keep up  with the technology behind these traps, including training them to identify and  locate the traps, and establish probable cause toward obtaining a search warrant  or consent to search the vehicle or residence in which the trap is located. DEA  expended $3 million on the CTI program in 2009, and seized over $28 million, in  addition to drugs and weapons. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bulk Cash Seizures </b>represent the cash proceeds obtained  from the illegal trafficking of drugs, weapons, and persons and are targeted by  DEA, FBI, ICE, and other federal and state and local law enforcement partners  for use in obtaining valuable investigative leads and intelligence data. Going  forward, information regarding bulk cash seizures will be simultaneously shared  between ICE’s Bulk Cash Smuggling Center (BCSC) in Vermont and the National  Seizure System (NSS) at EPIC. ICE’s BCSC is a 24/7 investigative support and  operations facility providing real-time tactical assistance to the field, while  the EPIC-NSS functions as, among other things, a repository for detailed bulk  currency seizure information from both domestic and foreign law enforcement  agencies. NSS analyzes volumes of bulk currency seizure data and develops  investigative lead reports and responds to requests for bulk currency seizure  data from agents and officers in the field. EPIC provides a broad spectrum of  interagency information and intelligence systems which are capable of  immediately assessing the information and assisting law enforcement agencies in  obtaining probable cause for search warrants, link cases together and follow up  on existing cases. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Since the FBI’s establishment of the <b><i>Safe Streets Violent Crimes  (SSVC) Initiative </i></b>in 1992, we have focused on violent gangs by  identifying major groups who act as significant criminal enterprises. The  Department’s goal is not just to disrupt their activities, but to dismantle  these dangerous gangs entirely. FBI agents assigned to each of the eight FBI  field offices along the border conduct multi-subject and multi-jurisdictional  investigations concentrating resources to remove the leadership and the most  dangerous gangs and seize their criminally obtained assets. As of March 1, 2010,  there were 124 pending kidnapping cases and 33 pending extortion cases  throughout the FBI’s eight border field offices. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the FBI has established <b><i>Violent Crime Safe Streets  Task Forces (SSTF) </i></b>in San Diego, Los Angeles, Phoenix, El Paso,  San Antonio, and Houston. By coordinating our efforts with partners at all  levels of law enforcement, we are able to leverage all available resources and  expertise while sharing intelligence and information. For its part, the SSTF  program also coordinates with our colleagues at the El Paso Intelligence Center,  the Southwest Intelligence Center, the Mexican Embassy and Mexican legal  attaché, as well as with Mexican law enforcement. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF): </i></b>The OCDETF program was initiated in 1982 to combine federal,  state, and local law enforcement efforts into a comprehensive attack against  organized crime and drug traffickers. DEA and the FBI are active components of  the OCDETF program, including OCDETF Strike Forces. OCDETF Strike Forces  collaborate with the Southwest Border High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area  (HIDTA) regional task forces in Arizona, California, New Mexico, West Texas, and  South Texas. Southwest Border HIDTA Task Forces represent federal, state, and  local partnerships that target Mexican drug cartels and their smuggling and  transportation networks that spawn cartel violence along the border. The  Southwest Border HIDTAs is one of 29 HIDTAs which are funded via the Office of  National Drug Control Policy. HIDTA Task Forces have had enormous success  dismantling major Mexican drug trafficking organizations linked to Mexico-based  cartels. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>DEA is a member of the DHS <b><i>Border Enforcement Security Task  Force (BEST)</i></b>, an ICE-led initiative designed to increase the flow  of information between participating agencies regarding transnational criminal  organizations and violent gangs operating along our shared borders. In  particular, BESTs target the underlying source of cross border violence along  the SWB: weapons smuggling, narcotics and human smuggling as well as bulk cash  smuggling. BESTs commenced in Laredo, Texas in July 2005; DEA’s participation in  the Laredo BEST began on May 3, 2006. Based on the success of the Laredo BEST,  the BEST program has expanded to 17 locations, 10 of which, including Laredo,  are situated along the SWB: Rio Grande Valley, Texas; El Paso, Texas; Las  Cruces, New Mexico; Deming, New Mexico; Tucson, Arizona; Phoenix. Arizona; Yuma,  Arizona; Imperial Valley, California; and San Diego, California. BESTs  incorporate personnel from ICE; CBP; USSS; DEA; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives; FBI; U.S. Coast Guard; and the U.S. Attorney’s Office,  along with other key federal, state, local and foreign law enforcement agencies  including the Mexican law enforcement agency Secretaria de Seguridad Publica  (SSP). </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Department’s <b><i>Drug Flow Attack Strategy (DFAS) </i></b>is an innovative, multi-agency strategy, designed to disrupt  significantly the flow of drugs, money, and chemicals between source zones and  the United States by attacking vulnerabilities in the supply chains,  transportation systems, and financial infrastructure of major drug trafficking  organizations. DFAS calls for aggressive, well-planned, and coordinated  enforcement operations in cooperation with host-nation counterparts in global  source and transit zones. <b><i>Operation All-Inclusive  (OAI)</i></b> is the primary DFAS enforcement component in the source and  transit zones. Iterations of OAI have been staged annually since 2005. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Operation Doble Via (ODV)</i></b>, the domestic component  of OAI, was conducted between April and September 2007 to disrupt the flow of  drugs, chemicals, and money across the SWB. ODV took place on both sides of the  border and the main participants were DEA, CBP, Texas Department of Public  Safety, and several Mexican agencies, including the Federal Investigative Agency  (AFI), the Federal Preventive Police (PFP), the military, and the Deputy  Attorney General’s Office of Special Investigations on Organized Crime (SIEDO).  <b><i>Operation Doble Via II </i></b>will be conducted this year,  with a focus on the Arizona-Mexico border. Through the collection of law  enforcement intelligence information and the development of investigations  specifically targeting the Arizona border region, ODV-II will seek to dismantle  those drug trafficking organizations and other armed groups responsible for the  violence in Sonora, Mexico and the movement of drugs, weapons, and money across  the border with Arizona. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>EPIC is a national tactical intelligence center that focuses its efforts on  supporting law enforcement efforts in the Western Hemisphere, with a significant  emphasis on the SWB. Through its 24-hour watch function, EPIC provides immediate  access to participating agencies' databases to law enforcement agents,  investigators, and analysts. This function is critical in the dissemination of  relevant information in support of tactical and investigative activities,  deconfliction, and officer safety. EPIC also provides significant, direct  tactical intelligence support to state and local law enforcement agencies,  especially in the areas of clandestine laboratory investigations and highway  interdiction. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>EPIC’s <b><i>Gatekeeper Project </i></b>is a comprehensive,  multi-source assessment of trafficking organizations involved in and controlling  movement of illegal contraband through “entry corridors” along the SWB. The  analysis of Gatekeeper organizations not only provides a better understanding of  command and control, organizational structure, and methods of operation, but  also serves as a guide for policymakers to initiate and prioritize operations by  U.S. anti-drug elements. Numerous “Gatekeepers” have direct links to Priority  Target Organizations and/or Consolidated Priority Organization Targets. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of <b><i>License Plate Readers (LPR) </i></b>along the SWB by the Department of Justice and Department of  Homeland Security has provided a surveillance method that uses optical character  recognition on images that read vehicle license plates. The purpose of the LPR  Initiative is to combine existing DEA and other law enforcement database  capabilities with new technology to identify and interdict conveyances being  utilized to transport bulk cash, drugs, and weapons, as well as other illegal  contraband. Almost 100 percent of the effort and cost associated with monitoring  southbound traffic is directed at the identification, seizure, and forfeiture of  bulk cash and weapons, while the effort and cost of monitoring northbound  traffic is both enforcement and forfeiture-related, in that suspect conveyances  can be identified for later southbound monitoring. DEA components have the  ability to query and input alerts on license plates via an existing DEA  database, and other law enforcement agencies can do the same via EPIC. DEA and  CBP are currently working together in order to merge existing CBP LPRs at the  points of entry with DEA’s LPR Initiative. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The OCDETF Fusion Center (OFC) provides investigative and operational  intelligence support to OCDETF investigations through the development of  organizational target profiles and the development of specific investigative  leads. These leads and intelligence products are disseminated to the appropriate  field elements of the OCDETF agencies through SOD. Intelligence and leads  relating to other criminal activities, including terrorism, are disseminated  through SOD to the appropriate agencies. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The DEA-led multi-agency Special Operations Division’s (SOD) mission is to  establish seamless law enforcement strategies and operations aimed at  dismantling national and international trafficking organizations by attacking  their command and control communications. SOD is able to facilitate coordination  and communication amongst law enforcement entities with overlapping  investigations and ensure tactical and operational intelligence is shared and  that enforcement operations and investigations are fully coordinated among and  between law enforcement agencies. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>The daily challenges posed by drug trafficking organizations in the United  States and Mexico are significant, but are overshadowed of late by a very  specific set of challenges: ensuring that the rampant violence in Mexico does  not spill over our border; closely monitoring the security situation in Mexico;  and, perhaps most importantly, lending our assistance and support to the  Calderon Administration to ensure its continued success against the ruthless and  powerful cartels. The GOM has realized enormous gains in re-establishing the  rule of law in Mexico, and in breaking the power and impunity of the DTOs who  threaten Mexico’s, and our, national security. The Calderon Administration’s  gains translate to an unparalleled positive impact on the U.S. drug market as  well: from January 2007 through December 2009, the price per gram of cocaine  increased 72 percent from $98.88 to $169.93, while the average purity decreased  by almost 33 percent. These statistics paint a clear picture of restricted drug  flow into the United States and decreased availability. While spikes—upward or  downward—in price and purity have been observed in the past, these indicators  typically normalize within a few months. Unlike in the past, we are now in the  midst of a sustained, three-year period of escalating prices and decreasing  purity. Anecdotal evidence from around the country and closer to home here in  the District of Columbia, including intercepted communications of the  traffickers themselves, corroborates the fact that President Calderon’s efforts  are making it more difficult for traffickers to supply the U.S. <br />market with  illicit drugs.</p>
<p>The Department recognizes that interagency and international collaboration  and coordination is fundamental to our success. It is imperative that we sustain  the positive momentum by supporting President Calderon’s heroic efforts against  organized crime. We must also manage expectations, as we anticipate that the  gruesome violence in Mexico may get worse before it gets better. We must  recognize that we are witnessing acts of true desperation: the actions of  wounded, vulnerable, and dangerous criminal organizations. We remain committed  to working with our U.S. law enforcement and intelligence partners as well, to  stem the flow of bulk cash and weapons south, while also working to sustain the  disruption of drug transportation routes northward. Bringing to the criminal and  civil justice system of the United States, or any other competent jurisdiction,  those organizations and principal members of organizations involved in the  cultivation, manufacture, and distribution of controlled substances appearing in  or destined for illicit trafficking in the United States remains the core of our  focus.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss this  important issue. We will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.</p>
