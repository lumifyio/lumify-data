<p class="TitleHeading"><span class="blackgraphtx">The gang estimates presented in the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment (NGTA) represent the collection of data provided by the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) through the National Drug Threat Survey, Bureau of Prisons, State Correctional Facilities, and National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC) law enforcement partners. An overview of how these numbers were collected is described within the Scope and Methodology Section of the NGTA. The estimates were provided on a voluntary basis and may include estimates of gang members as well as gang associates. Likewise, these estimates may not capture gang membership in jurisdictions that may have underreported or that declined to report. Based on these estimates, geospatial maps were prepared to visually display the reporting jurisdictions. <br /><br />The data used to calculate street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gang estimates nationwide in the report are derived primarily from NDIC&rsquo;s National Drug Threat Survey. These estimates do not affect the qualitative findings of the 2011 NGTA and were used primarily to create the maps highlighting gang activity nationally. After further review of these estimates, the maps originally provided in 2011 NGTA were revised to show state-level representation of gang activity per capita and by law enforcement officers. This maintains consistency with the 2009 NGTA report&rsquo;s maps on gang activity. <br /><br />During the years the NGTA is published, many entities&mdash;news media, tourism agencies, and other groups with an interest in crime in our nation</span><span class="blackgraphtx">&mdash;</span><span class="blackgraphtx">use reported figures to compile rankings of cities and counties. These rankings, however, do not provide insight into the many variables that mold the crime in a particular town, city, county, state, region, or other jurisdiction. Consequently, these rankings lead to simplistic and or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting cities and counties, along with residents. <br /><br />The FBI and the NGIC do not recommend that jurisdictions use the estimated gang membership totals as exact counts for the numbers of gang members. These numbers are not used by the FBI or NGIC to rank jurisdictions on gang activity. The FBI and NGIC recommend contacting state and local law enforcement agencies for more information related to specific gang activity. </span></p>

The 2011  NGTA enhances and builds on the gang-related trends and criminal threats  identified in the 2009 assessment. It supports US Department of Justice  strategic objectives 2.2 (to reduce the threat, incidence, and  prevalence of violent crime) and 2.4 (to reduce the threat, trafficking,  use, and related violence of illegal drugs). The assessment is based on  federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and corrections  agency intelligence, including information and data provided by the  National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) and the National Gang Center.  Additionally, this assessment is supplemented by information retrieved  from open source documents and data collected through April 2011.</span></p>
<p class="TitleHeading"><b><span class="blackgraphtx"><a name="Scope"></a>Scope and Methodology</span></b></p>
<p class="BodyCopy"><span class="blackgraphtx">In 2009, the NGIC  released its second threat assessment on gang activity in the United  States. The NGIC and its law enforcement partners documented increases  in gang proliferation and migration nationwide and emerging  threats.&nbsp;This report attempts to expand on these findings.&nbsp;Reporting and  intelligence collected over the past two years have demonstrated  increases in the number of gangs and gang members as law enforcement  authorities nationwide continue to identify gang members and share  information regarding these groups.&nbsp;Better reporting and collection has  contributed greatly to the increased documentation and reporting of gang  members and gang trends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Information in  the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment-Emerging Trends was derived  from law enforcement intelligence, open source information, and data  collected from the NDIC, including the 2010 NDIC National Drug Threat  Survey (NDTS). NGIC law enforcement partners provided information and  guidance regarding new trends and intelligence through an online request  for information via the NGIC Law Enforcement Online (LEO) Special  Interest Group (SIG), which is now NGIC Online.&nbsp;Law enforcement agencies  nationwide continuously report new and emerging gang trends to the  NGIC, as the NGIC continues to operate as a repository and dissemination  hub for gang intelligence.&nbsp;This information provided by our law  enforcement partners was used to identify many of the trends and issues  included in this report.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Reporting used  to quantify the number of street and outlaw motorcycle gangs and gang  members was primarily derived from the 2010 NDIC NDTS data and some  supplemental NGIC reporting from our law enforcement partners. NDIC  annually conducts the NDTS to collect data on the threat posed by  various illicit drugs in the United States. A stratified random sample  of nearly 3,500 state and local law enforcement agencies was surveyed to  generate national, regional, and state estimates of various aspects of  drug trafficking activities including the threat posed by various drugs,  the availability and production of illicit drugs, as well as the role  of street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs in drug trafficking  activity. Weighted national, regional, and state-level statistical  estimates derived from NDTS 2010 data was based on responses received  from 2,963 law enforcement agencies out of a sample of 3,465 agencies. <br /></span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">In previous iterations of the NDTS, survey responses were validated through targeted outreach to jurisdictions. In the 2010 NDTS, the key assumption was that individual respondents provided estimates on gang members for their jurisdictions only and did not include other jurisdictions. However, NGIC acknowledges that there may be some duplication or underreporting of gang members because of variations in each jurisdiction&rsquo;s process to estimate gang activity. </span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">In calculating the number of street and outlaw motorcycle gang members, respondents in each region were asked to select from a series of ranges of numbers. The median numbers of each range were aggregated to generate an estimate for the total number of gang members. In calculating the number of street and outlaw motorcycle gangs, the low end of each range was aggregated to generate an estimate for the total number of gangs and gang members. Prison gang member estimates were derived directly from the US Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and state correctional institutions across the country.</span></p>
<p class="TitleHeading"><b><span class="blackgraphtx"><a name="About"></a>About the NGIC</span></b></p>
<p class="BodyCopy"><span class="blackgraphtx">The NGIC was established  by Congress in 2005 to support law enforcement agencies through timely  and accurate information sharing and strategic/tactical analysis of  federal, state, and local law enforcement information focusing on the  growth, migration, criminal activity, and association of gangs that pose  a significant threat to communities throughout the United States. The  NGIC is comprised of representatives from the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), US Bureau  of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), US Bureau of  Prisons (BOP), United States Marshals Service (USMS), US Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE), US Department of Defense (DOD), National  Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC), and US Customs and Border Protection  (CBP). This multi-agency fusion center integrates gang intelligence  assets to serve as a central intelligence resource for gang information  and analytical support.</span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">To assist in the  sharing of gang intelligence with law enforcement, the NGIC has  established NGIC Online, an information system comprised of a set of  web-based tools designed for researching gang-related intelligence and  sharing of information with federal, state, local and tribal law  enforcement partners. The system&rsquo;s Request for Information (RFI) portal  encourages users to contribute new data as well as conduct gang research  through custom threat assessments and/or liaison with NGIC&rsquo;s network of  national subject matter experts. NGIC Online functions include RFI  submissions and responses; Gang Encyclopedia WIKI; General Intelligence  Library; and a Signs, Symbols, and Tattoos (SST) database with user  submissions.</span></p>

<p class="TitleHeading"><b><span class="blackgraphtx"><a name="Executive"></a>Executive Summary</span></b></p>
<p class="BodyCopy"><span class="blackgraphtx">Gangs continue to commit  criminal activity, recruit new members in urban, suburban, and rural  regions across the United States, and develop criminal associations that  expand their influence over criminal enterprises, particularly  street-level drug sales. The most notable trends for 2011 have been the  overall increase in gang membership, and the expansion of criminal  street gangs&rsquo; control of street-level drug sales and collaboration with  rival gangs and other criminal organizations.<sup>a</sup></span></p>
<p class="TitleHeading"><b><span class="blackgraphtx"><a name="Key"></a>Key Findings</span></b></p>
<p class="Bullets"><span class="blackgraphtx">Gangs are expanding,  evolving and posing an increasing threat to US communities nationwide.  Many gangs are sophisticated criminal networks with members who are  violent, distribute wholesale quantities of drugs, and develop and  maintain close working relationships with members and associates of  transnational criminal/drug trafficking organizations. Gangs are  becoming more violent while engaging in less typical and lower-risk  crime, such as prostitution and white-collar crime. Gangs are more  adaptable, organized, sophisticated, and opportunistic, exploiting new  and advanced technology as a means to recruit, communicate discretely,  target their rivals, and perpetuate their criminal activity. Based on  state, local, and federal law enforcement reporting, the NGIC concludes  that:</span><span class="blackgraphtx">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">There are approximately  1.4 million active street, prison, and OMG gang members comprising more  than 33,000 gangs in the United States. Gang membership increased most  significantly in the Northeast and Southeast regions, although the West  and Great Lakes regions boast the highest number of gang members.  Neighborhood-based gangs, hybrid gang members, and national-level gangs  such as the Sure&ntilde;os are rapidly expanding in many jurisdictions. Many  communities are also experiencing an increase in ethnic-based gangs such  as African, Asian, Caribbean, and Eurasian gangs.</span></li>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">Gangs are responsible for  an average of 48 percent of violent crime in most jurisdictions and up  to 90 percent in several others, according to NGIC analysis. Major  cities and suburban areas experience the most gang-related violence.  Local neighborhood-based gangs and drug crews continue to pose the most  significant criminal threat in most communities. Aggressive recruitment  of juveniles and immigrants, alliances and conflict between gangs, the  release of incarcerated gang members from prison, advancements in  technology and communication, and Mexican Drug Trafficking Organization  (MDTO) involvement in drug distribution have resulted in gang expansion  and violence in a number of jurisdictions.</span></li>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">Gangs are increasingly  engaging in non-traditional gang-related crime, such as alien smuggling,  human trafficking, and prostitution. Gangs are also engaging in white-collar</span><span class="blackgraphtx"> crime such as counterfeiting, identity theft, and mortgage fraud,  primarily due to the high profitability and much lower visibility and  risk of detection and punishment than drug and weapons trafficking.</span></li>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">US-based gangs have  established strong working relationships with Central American and MDTOs  to perpetrate illicit cross-border activity, as well as with some  organized crime groups in some regions of the United States. US-based  gangs and MDTOs are establishing wide-reaching drug networks; assisting  in the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and illegal immigrants along the  Southwest Border; and serving as enforcers for MDTO interests on the US  side of the border.</span></li>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">Many gang members continue  to engage in gang activity while incarcerated. Family members play  pivotal roles in assisting or facilitating gang activities and  recruitment during a gang members&rsquo; incarceration. Gang members in some  correctional facilities are adopting radical religious views while  incarcerated.</span></li>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">Gangs encourage members,  associates, and relatives to obtain law enforcement, judiciary, or legal  employment in order to gather information on rival gangs and law  enforcement operations. Gang infiltration of the military continues to  pose a significant criminal threat, as members of at least 53 gangs have  been identified on both domestic and international military  installations. Gang members who learn advanced weaponry and combat  techniques in the military are at risk of employing these skills on the  street when they return to their communities.</span></li>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">Gang members are acquiring  high-powered, military-style weapons and equipment which poses a  significant threat because of the potential to engage in lethal  encounters with law enforcement officers and civilians. Typically  firearms are acquired through illegal purchases; straw purchases via  surrogates or middle-men, and thefts from individuals, vehicles,  residences and commercial establishments. Gang members also target  military and law enforcement officials, facilities, and vehicles to  obtain weapons, ammunition, body armor, police gear, badges, uniforms,  and official identification.</span></li>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">Gangs on Indian  Reservations often emulate national-level gangs and adopt names and  identifiers from nationally recognized urban gangs. Gang members on some  Indian Reservations are associating with gang members in the community  to commit crime.</span></li>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">Gangs are becoming  increasingly adaptable and sophisticated, employing new and advanced  technology to facilitate criminal activity discreetly, enhance their  criminal operations, and connect with other gang members, criminal  organizations, and potential recruits nationwide and even worldwide.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="TitleHeading"><b><span class="blackgraphtx"><a name="CurrentGang"></a>Current Gang-Related Trends and Crime</span></b></p>
<p class="BodyCopy"><span class="blackgraphtx">Gang membership continues  to expand throughout communities nationwide, as gangs evolve, adapt to  new threats, and form new associations. Consequently, gang-related crime  and violence is increasing as gangs employ violence and intimidation to  control their territory and illicit operations. Many gangs have  advanced beyond their traditional role as local retail drug distributors  in large cities to become more organized, adaptable, and influential in  large-scale drug trafficking. Gang members are migrating from urban  areas to suburban and rural communities to recruit new members, expand  their drug distribution territories, form new alliances, and collaborate  with rival gangs and criminal organizations for profit and influence.  Local neighborhood, hybrid and female gang membership is on the rise in  many communities. Prison gang members, who exert control over many  street gang members, often engage in crime and violence upon their  return to the community. Gang members returning to the community from  prison have an adverse and lasting impact on neighborhoods, which may  experience notable increases in crime, violence, and drug trafficking.</span></p>
<p class="Subhead1"><i><b><span class="blackgraphtx">Gang Membership and Expansion<sup>b</sup></span></b></i></p>
<p class="BodyCopy"><span class="blackgraphtx">Approximately 1.4 million  active street, OMG, and prison gang members, comprising more than  33,000 gangs, are criminally active within all 50 US states, the  District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (see Appendix A). This represents a  40 percent increase from an estimated 1 million gang members in 2009.  The NGIC attributes this increase in gang membership primarily to  improved reporting, more aggressive recruitment efforts by gangs, the  formation of new gangs, new opportunities for drug trafficking, and  collaboration with rival gangs and drug trafficking organizations  (DTOs). Law enforcement in several jurisdictions also attribute the  increase in gang membership in their region to the gangster rap culture,  the facilitation of communication and recruitment through the Internet  and social media, the proliferation of generational gang members, and a  shortage of resources to combat gangs.</span></p>
<p class="mediumindentedtext" style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px; "><b><span class="blackgraphtx">More than half  of NGIC law enforcement partners report an increase in gang-related  criminal activity in their jurisdictions over the past two years.  Neighborhood-based gangs continue to pose the greatest threat in most  jurisdictions nationwide.</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">NGIC and NDIC data  indicates that, since 2009, gang membership increased most significantly  in the Northeast and Southeast regions, although the West and North  Central regions&mdash;particularly Arizona, California, and Illinois&mdash;boast the  highest number of gang members.</span><span class="blackgraphtx">&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">&nbsp;</span><span class="blackgraphtx">Sure&ntilde;o gangs, including  Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), 18th Street, and Florencia 13, are expanding  faster than other national-level gangs, both in membership and  geographically. Twenty states and the District of Columbia report an  increase of Sure&ntilde;o migration into their region over the past three  years. California has experienced a substantial migration of Sure&ntilde;o  gangs into northern California and neighboring states, such as Arizona,  Nevada, and Oregon.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">Law enforcement reporting indicates a significant increase in OMGs in a number of jurisdictions, with approximately 44,000 members nationwide comprising approximately 3,000 gangs.<sup>c</sup> Jurisdictions in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia are experiencing the most significant increase in OMGs, increasing the potential for gang-related turf wars with other local OMGs. The Wheels of Soul (WOS), Mongols, Outlaws, Pagans and Vagos have expanded in several states.</span></li>

<p class="Subhead1"><i><b><span class="blackgraphtx">Gang-Related Violent Crime</span></b></i></p>
<p class="BodyCopy"><span class="blackgraphtx">Gang-related crime and  violence continues to rise. NGIC analysis indicates that gang members  are responsible for an average of 48 percent of violent crime in most  jurisdictions and much higher in others. Some jurisdictions in Arizona,  California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, and Texas  report that gangs are responsible for at least 90 percent of crime. A  comparison of FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) 2009 violent crime data  and 2010 NGIC gang data illustrates that regions experiencing the most  violent crime&mdash;including southern California, Texas, and Florida&mdash;also  have a substantial gang presence (see Figure 1 and Map 1). Street gangs  are involved in a host of violent criminal activities, including  assault, drug trafficking, extortion, firearms offenses, home invasion  robberies, homicide, intimidation, shootings, and weapons trafficking.  NDIC reporting indicates that gang control over drug distribution and  disputes over drug territory has increased, which may be responsible for  the increase in violence in many areas. Conflict between gangs, gang  migration into rival gang territory, and the release of incarcerated  gang members back into the community has also resulted in an increase in  gang-related crime and violence in many jurisdictions, according to  NGIC reporting.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">Law enforcement officials  in the Washington, DC metropolitan region are concerned about a spate of  gang-related violence in their area. In February 2011, ICE officials  indicted 11 MS-13 members for a two-year spree of murders, stabbings,  assaults, robberies, and drug distribution.

<p class="BodyCopy"><span class="blackgraphtx">Gang involvement and  control of the retail drug trade poses a serious threat to public safety  and stability in most major cities and in many mid-size cities because  such distribution activities are routinely associated with lethal  violence. Violent disputes over control of drug territory and  enforcement of drug debts frequently occur among gangs in both urban and  suburban areas, as gangs expand their control of drug distribution in  many jurisdictions, according to NDIC and NGIC reporting.

The alien smuggling networks that operate along the Southwest border are unable to move human cargo through drug cartel controlled corridors without paying a fee. The typical Mexican illegal alien now pays approximately $1,200 to $2,500 for entry into the United States. The fee is considerably higher for aliens smuggled from countries other than Mexico, which may even be more alluring for the cartels.

Gang members on Indian Reservations often  emulate national-level gangs and adopt names and identifiers from  nationally recognized urban gangs. However, emulation is most often  limited to identifiers&mdash;colors, signs, symbols, names&mdash;and leadership  structure is often loosely organized or absent. NGIC reporting indicates  that national-level gangs such as the Barrio Azteca, Bloods, Crips,  Mexican Mafia, and Norte&ntilde;os are operating on a number of Indian  Reservations. Native American gang members on reservations are also  involved in gang-related activity with gang members in communities  outside of reservations.</span></p>
<p class="mediumindentedtext" style="padding-left: 30px; "><b><span class="blackgraphtx">NGIC reporting  indicates that urban gangs such as the Norte&ntilde;os and Sure&ntilde;os associate  and/or influence the gang culture on several Indian Reservations.</span></b></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">In some  jurisdictions, Native American gang members are associated with or  involved in gang-related criminal activity with gang members off the  reservation, including drug distribution, money laundering, assaults,  and intimidation. Partnerships are often established for financial gain,  drug distribution, and to evade law enforcement.</span></p>

<li><span class="blackgraphtx">The Warm Springs Indian  Reservation in Oregon is becoming an ideal location for illicit  marijuana farms because of its fertile grounds and isolated location.  Within the past few years authorities have seized at least 12,000  harvested adult marijuana plants with an estimated street value of $10  million.<sup>37</sup></span></li>

<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Geography, as  well as the extent of law enforcement monitoring of the reservations,  make some Indian Reservations conducive to cross-border drug  trafficking.</span></p>

<p class="BodyCopy"><span class="blackgraphtx">Gang recruitment of  active duty military personnel constitutes a significant criminal threat  to the US military. Members of nearly every major street gang, as well  as some prison gangs and OMGs, have been reported on both domestic and  international military installations, according to NGIC analysis and  multiple law enforcement reporting. Through transfers and deployments,  military-affiliated gang members expand their culture and operations to  new regions nationwide and worldwide, undermining security and law  enforcement efforts to combat crime. Gang members with military training  pose a unique threat to law enforcement personnel because of their  distinctive weapons and combat training skills and their ability to  transfer these skills to fellow gang members.</span></p>
<p class="mediumindentedtext" style="padding-left: 30px; "><b><span class="blackgraphtx">NGIC reporting  indicates that law enforcement officials in at least 100 jurisdictions  have come into contact with, detained, or arrested an active duty or  former military gang member within the past three years.</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">Gang members have been reported in every branch of the US military<sup>n</sup>,  although a large proportion of these gang members and dependent gang  members of military personnel are affiliated with the US Army, Army  Reserves, and National Guard branches.</span><span class="blackgraphtx"> <br /></span></li>

<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Many street gang  members join the military to escape the gang lifestyle or as an  alternative to incarceration, but often revert back to their gang  associations once they encounter other gang members in the military.  Other gangs target the US military and defense systems to expand their  territory, facilitate criminal activity such as weapons and drug  trafficking, or to receive weapons and combat training that they may  transfer back to their gang. Incidents of weapons theft and trafficking  may have a negative impact on public safety or pose a threat to law  enforcement officials.</span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">As of April  2011, the NGIC has identified members of at least 53 gangs whose members  have served in or are affiliated with US military. Among the identified  gangs with military-trained members are street gangs such as the Asian  Boyz, Bloods, Crips, Gangster Disciples, Latin Kings, MS-13, Sure&ntilde;os,  Tiny Rascal Gangsters, and the Juggalos; the Aryan Brotherhood, Barrio  Azteca, and Texas Syndicate prison gangs; and OMGs including the  Bandidos, Hells Angels, Mongols, Outlaws, and Vagos. Some gangs,  particularly OMGs, actively recruit members with military training or  advise members without criminal records to join the military for  necessary weapons and combat training.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="blackgraphtx">Younger gang members  without criminal records are attempting to join the military, as well as  concealing tattoos and gang affiliation during the recruitment process,  according to NGIC reporting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Deployments have  resulted in integrating gang members with service members and/or  dependents on or near overseas military installations, including those  in Afghanistan, Germany, Iraq, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. US  military officials have reported a rise in gang graffiti both on and off  post in Afghanistan and Iraq (see Figure 11).</span></p>

<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">The US Southwest Border region<sup>o</sup> represents a continuing criminal threat to the United States. The  rugged, rural, and porous area along the nearly 2,000 miles of  contiguous US-Mexican territory invites widespread criminal activity,  including drug and arms trafficking, alien smuggling, human trafficking,  extortion, kidnapping, and public corruption. US-based gangs, MDTOs,  and other criminal enterprises in both the United States and Mexico are  readily exploiting this fluid region and incur enormous profit by  establishing wide-reaching drug networks; assisting in the smuggling  drugs, arms, and illegal immigrants; and serving as enforcers for MDTO  interests on the US side of the border. </span><span class="blackgraphtx">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Violence in  Mexico&mdash;particularly in its northern border states&mdash;has escalated with  over 34,000 murders committed in Mexico over the past four years.<sup>38</sup> While intensified scrutiny from Mexican law enforcement has forced  significant disruptions in several dangerous MDTOs, such disruptions  have also served to disrupt the balance of power among these  organizations. This has prompted drug cartel rivalries to employ more  aggressive tactics as they attempt to assert control over the Southwest  border region and its highly lucrative drug trafficking corridors.<sup>39</sup> Although the majority of the violence from feuding drug cartels occurs  in Mexico,<sup>p</sup> Mexican drug cartel activity has fueled crime in the porous US  Southwest Border region, where easy access to weapons, a high demand for  drugs, ample opportunity for law enforcement corruption, and a large  Hispanic population ripe for recruitment and exploitation exists.<sup>40</sup></span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Hispanic prison  gangs along the Southwest border region are strengthening their ties  with MDTOs to acquire wholesale quantities of drugs, according to NDIC  reporting.<sup>41</sup> In exchange for a consistent drug supply, US-based gangs  smuggle and distribute drugs, collect drug proceeds, launder money,  smuggle weapons, commit kidnappings, and serve as lookouts and enforcers  on behalf of the MDTOs. MDTOs subsequently profit from increased drug  circulation in the United States, while US-based gangs have access to a  consistent drug supply which expands their influence, power, and ability  to recruit.<sup>42</sup></span></p>
<p class="mediumindentedtext" style="padding-left: 30px; "><b><span class="blackgraphtx">According to  NDIC reporting, more than 45 percent of law enforcement agencies in the  Southwestern United States report that gangs in their jurisdiction are  moderately to highly involved in drug activity, while 30 percent  indicate that street gang involvement in drug activity increased within  the past year.</span></b></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Gang-related  activity and violence has increased along the Southwest border region,  as US-based gangs seek to prove their worth to the drug cartels, compete  with other gangs for favor, and act as US-based enforcers for cartels  which involves home invasions, robbery, kidnapping, and murder.</span></p>

According to law enforcement officials in the Pacific  Region, members of several gangs, including the Hells Angels and Asian  gangs, engage in cross-border criminal activity in their jurisdictions.&nbsp;</span></p>

MDTOs have posted hundreds of videos depicting interrogations or executions of rival MDTO members. Other postings include video montages of luxury vehicles, weapons, and money set to the music of songs with lyrics that glorify the drug lifestyle.

The majority of NGIC law enforcement partners report that  their agency has or participates in a gang task force, and most utilize a  gang database to track and monitor gang members in their jurisdictions.  There are 168 FBI Violent Gang Task Forces in the United States, Puerto  Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. In addition, ATF operates 31 Violent  Crime Impact Teams (VCIT) and ICE operates eight Operation Community  Shield (OCS) Initiatives nationwide (see Appendix C).

<p class="TitleHeading"><b><span class="blackgraphtx"><a name="Outlook"></a>Outlook</span></b></p>
<p class="TitleHeading"><span class="blackgraphtx">Street,  prison, and motorcycle gang membership and criminal activity continues  to flourish in US communities where gangs identify opportunities to  control street level drug sales, and other profitable crimes. Gangs will  not only continue to defend their territory from rival gangs, but will  also increasingly seek to diversify both their membership and their  criminal activities in recognition of potential financial gain. New  alliances between rival gangs will likely form as gangs suspend their  former racial ideologies in pursuit of mutual profit. Gangs will  continue to evolve and adapt to current conditions and law enforcement  tactics, diversify their criminal activity, and employ new strategies  and technology to enhance their criminal operations, while facilitating  lower-risk and more profitable schemes, such as white-collar</span><span class="blackgraphtx"> crime.</span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">The expansion of  communication networks, especially in wireless communications and the  Internet, will allow gang members to form associations and alliances  with other gangs and criminal organizations&mdash;both domestically and  internationally&mdash;and enable gang members to better facilitate criminal  activity and enhance their criminal operations discreetly without the  physical interfacing once necessary to conduct these activities.</span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Changes in  immigrant populations, which are susceptible to victimization and  recruitment by gangs, may have the most profound effect on street gang  membership. Continued drug trafficking-related violence along the US  Southwest border could trigger increased migration of Mexicans and  Central Americans into the United States and, as such, provide a greater  pool of victims, recruits, and criminal opportunities for street gangs  as they seek to profit from the illegal drug trade, alien smuggling, and  weapons trafficking. Likewise, increased gang recruitment of youths  among the immigrant population may result in an increase in gang  membership and gang-related violence in a number of regions.</span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Street gang  activity and violence may also increase as more dangerous gang members  are released early from prison and re-establish their roles armed with  new knowledge and improved techniques. Prison gang members, already an  ideal target audience for radicalization, may expand their associations  with foreign gang members or radical criminal organizations, both inside  correctional institutions and in the community upon their release.</span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Gang members  armed with high-powered weapons and knowledge and expertise acquired  from employment in law enforcement, corrections, or the military may  pose an increasing nationwide threat, as they employ these tactics and  weapons against law enforcement officials, rival gang members, and  civilians.</span></p>
<p class="BodyCopy-Indented"><span class="blackgraphtx">Globalization,  socio-political change, technological advances, and immigration will  result either in greater gang expansion and gang-related crime or  displace gang members as they search for criminal opportunities  elsewhere. Stagnant or poor economic conditions in the United States,  including budget cuts in law enforcement, may undercut gang  dismantlement efforts and encourage gang expansion as police agencies  redirect their resources and disband gang units and taskforces, as  reported by a large number of law enforcement agencies.</span></p>
