LUMIFY
========

Lumify allows the analyst to create a graph structure of information from both structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.  It is an open source big data analysis and knowledge discovery platform with a web-based UI for exploring.  Lumify has the ability to customize the ontology for your data and visualize the information via geo-location and both 2D and 3D graph visualizations.
