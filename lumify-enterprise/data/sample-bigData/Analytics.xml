      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Google Analytics Sample Dashboard.jpg|thumb|alt=Alternative text|A sample Google Analytics dashboard. Tools like this help businesses identify trends and make decisions.]] '''Analytics''' is the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data. Especially valuable in areas rich with recorded information, analytics relies on the simultaneous application of [[statistics]], [[computer programming]] and [[operations research]] to quantify performance. Analytics often favors [[data visualization]] to communicate insight.

Firms may commonly apply analytics to business data, to describe, predict, and improve business performance. Specifically, arenas within analytics include [[enterprise decision management]], retail analytics, store assortment and SKU optimization, marketing optimization and marketing mix analytics, [[web analytics]], sales force sizing and optimization, price and promotion modeling, predictive science, credit [[risk analysis (business)#|risk analysis]], and [[fraud detection|fraud analytics]]. Since analytics can require extensive computation (See [[Big Data]]), the algorithms and software used for analytics harness the most current methods in computer science, statistics, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohavi, Rothleder and Simoudis|title=Emerging Trends in Business Analytics|journal=Communications of the ACM|year=2002|volume=45|issue=8|pages=45–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytics vs. analysis==
Analytics is a two-sided coin. On one side, it uses descriptive and predictive models to gain valuable knowledge from data - data analysis. On the other, analytics uses this insight to recommend action or to guide decision making - communication. Thus, analytics is not so much concerned with individual analyses or analysis steps, but with the entire [[methodology]]. There is a pronounced tendency to use the term ''analytics'' in business settings e.g. [[text analytics]] vs. the more generic [[text mining]] to emphasize this broader perspective.

=='''Customer Analytics'''==
Every organizations -  Banks , Retailer, Telecom Or Pharma -are looking for ways to understand their customers better and bring new ideas to acquire new customers, grow relationship size of the existing customers, manage or maintain the existing customer relationship. Acquisition, Development and Retention are the stages of customer life cycle. Customer analytics helps the organizations across customer life cycle. The big data analytics can helps the banks across [http://ramganalytics.com/leveraging-big-data-analytics-across-customer-life-cycle-for-retail-bank/ customer life cycle].
=== Marketing optimization ===
Marketing has evolved from a creative process into a highly data-driven process.  Marketing organizations use analytics to determine the outcomes of campaigns or efforts and to guide decisions for investment and consumer targeting.  Demographic studies, customer segmentation, conjoint analysis and other techniques allow marketers to use large amounts of consumer purchase, survey and panel data to understand and communicate marketing strategy.  

[[Web analytics]] allows marketers to collect session-level information about interactions on a website.  Those interactions provide the web analytics information systems with the information to track the referrer, search keywords, IP address, and activities of the visitor.  With this information, a marketer can improve the marketing campaigns, site creative content, and information architecture. 

Analysis techniques frequently used in marketing include marketing mix modeling, pricing and promotion analyses, sales force optimization, customer analytics e.g.: segmentation. Web analytics and optimization of web sites and online campaigns now frequently works hand in hand with the more traditional marketing analysis techniques. A focus on digital media has slightly changed the vocabulary so that marketing mix modeling is commonly referred to as attribution modeling in the digital or [[Marketing mix modeling|mixed-media]] context. 

These tools and techniques support both strategic marketing decisions (such as how much overall to spend on marketing and how to allocate budgets across a portfolio of brands and the marketing mix) and more tactical campaign support in terms of targeting the best potential customer with the optimal message in the most cost effective medium at the ideal time. An example of the holistic approach required for this strategy is the [http://exchanges.wiley.com/blog/2013/06/06/analytics-astronomy-unlocking-the-physics-of-the-web/ Astronomy Model].

=== Portfolio analysis ===
A common application of business analytics is [[Portfolio finance|portfolio analysis]]. In this, a [[bank]] or lending agency has a collection of accounts of varying [[Value economics|value]] and [[risk]]. The accounts may differ by the social status (wealthy, middle-class, poor, etc.) of the holder, the geographical location, its net value, and many other factors.  The lender must balance the return on the [[loan]] with the risk of default for each loan. The question is then how to evaluate the portfolio as a whole.

The least risk loan may be to the very wealthy, but there are a very limited number of wealthy people.  On the other hand there are many poor that can be lent to, but at greater risk.  Some balance must be struck that maximizes return and minimizes risk.  The analytics solution may combine [[time series]] analysis, with many other issues in order to make decisions on when to lend money to these different borrower segments, or decisions on the interest rate charged to members of a portfolio segment to cover any losses among members in that segment.

=== Risk analytics ===

Predictive models in banking industry is widely developed to bring certainty across the risk scores for individual customers. Credit scores are built to predict individual’s delinquency behaviour and also scores are widely used to evaluate the credit worthiness of each applicant and rated while processing loan applications.

==Challenges==
In the industry of commercial analytics software, an emphasis has emerged on solving the challenges of analyzing massive, complex data sets, often when such data is in a constant state of change. Such data sets are commonly referred to as [[big data]]. Whereas once the problems posed by big data were only found in the scientific community, today big data is a problem for many businesses that operate transactional systems online and, as a result, amass large volumes of data quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naone|first=Erica|title=The New Big Data|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/38397/|publisher=Technology Review, MIT|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of [[unstructured data]] types is another challenge getting attention in the industry. Unstructured data differs from [[structured data]] in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inmon|first=Bill|title=Tapping Into Unstructured Data|year=2007|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-236029-6|author=Nesavich, Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of unstructured data, such as email, the contents of word processor documents, PDFs, geospatial data, etc., are rapidly becoming a relevant source of [[business intelligence]] for businesses, governments and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wise|first=Lyndsay|title=Data Analysis and Unstructured Data|url=http://www.dashboardinsight.com/articles/business-performance-management/data-analysis-and-unstructured-data.aspx|publisher=Dashboard Insight|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Britain the discovery that one company was illegally selling fraudulent doctor's notes in order to assist people in defrauding employers and insurance companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fake doctors' sick notes for Sale for £25, NHS fraud squad warns|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2626120/Fake-doctors-sick-notes-for-sale-on-web-for-25-NHS-fraud-squad-warns.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=August 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an opportunity for insurance firms to increase the vigilance of their unstructured data analysis. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that big data analysis could save the American health care system $300 billion per year and the European public sector €250 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Data: The next frontier for innovation, competition and productivity as reported in Building with Big Data|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18741392|accessdate=May 26, 2011 | work=The Economist|date=May 26, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110603031738/http://www.economist.com/node/18741392| archivedate= 3 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These challenges are the current inspiration for much of the innovation in modern analytics information systems, giving birth to relatively new machine analysis concepts such as [[complex event processing]], full text search and analysis, and even new ideas in presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Dan|title=Mobililty: Fueling a Brainier Business Intelligence|url=http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/guestopinions/blog/mobility-fueling-a-brainier-business-intelligence/?cs=47491|publisher=IT Business Edge|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such innovation is the introduction of grid-like architecture in machine analysis, allowing increases in the speed of massively parallel processing by distributing the workload to many computers all with equal access to the complete data set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khambadkone|first=Krish|title=Are You Ready for Big Data?|url=http://www.infogain.com/company/perspective-big-data.jsp|publisher=InfoGain|accessdate=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analytics is increasingly used in [[education]], particularly at the district and government office levels. However, the complexity of student performance measures presents challenges when educators try to understand and use analytics to discern patterns in student performance, predict graduation likelihood, improve chances of student success, etc. For example, in a study involving districts known for strong data use, 48% of teachers had difficulty posing questions prompted by data, 36% did not comprehend given data, and 52% incorrectly interpreted data.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development (2009). ''Implementing data-informed decision making in schools: Teacher access, supports and use.'' United States Department of Education (ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. ED504191) &lt;/ref&gt; To combat this, some analytics tools for educators adhere to an over-the-counter data format (embedding labels, supplemental documentation, and a help system, and making key package/display and content decisions) to improve educators’ understanding and use of the analytics being displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. (2013, March 28). [https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/recording/playback/link/table/dropin?sid=2008350&amp;suid=D.4DF60C7117D5A77FE3AED546909ED2 How data Systems &amp; reports can either fight or propagate the data analysis error epidemic, and how educator leaders can help.] ''Presentation conducted from Technology Information Center for Administrative Leadership (TICAL) School Leadership Summit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

One more emerging challenge is dynamic regulatory needs. For example, in the banking industry, Basel III and future capital adequacy needs are likely to make even smaller banks adopt internal risk models.  In such incidents, cloud computing and open source R can help smaller banks to adopt risk analytics and support branch level monitoring by applying predictive analytics.{{cn|date=November 2012}}
