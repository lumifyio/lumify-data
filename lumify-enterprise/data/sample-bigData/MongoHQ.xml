'''MongoHQ''' is a private, Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platform for securely hosting and managing shared and dedicated [[MongoDB]] instances. MongoHQ is used by a majority of the cloud hosting service [[Heroku]]'s MongoDB users, being the only remote Mongo host for over a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2010/4/30/mongohq_add_on_public_beta/ MongoHQ Add-on Public Beta | Heroku Blog | Apr 30, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

MongoHQ is an alumnus of the [[Y_Combinator_(company)|Y Combinator]] business incubator, Summer 2011 class.

In July 2011, MongoHQ announced it received its first round of angel investment of $417,000 from Y Combinator, Lerer And SV Angel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/24/mongohq-raises-417k-from-y-combinator-lehrer-and-sv-angel/ MongoHQ Raises $417K From Y Combinator, Lerer And SV Angel | TechCrunch | June 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, MongoHQ acquired the competing Mongo host and automated provisioning software of MongoMachines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2819301 MongoHQ Acquires MongoMachine | Y Combinator News | July 28, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
