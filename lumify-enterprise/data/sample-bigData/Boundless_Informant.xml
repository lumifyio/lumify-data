'''Boundless Informant''' is a [[big data]] analysis and [[data visualization]] system used by the [[United States]] [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) to give NSA managers summaries of NSA's world wide data collection activities.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-boundless-informant-global-datamining |title=Boundless Informant: the NSA's secret tool to track global surveillance data &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is described in an unclassified, [[For Official Use Only]] [[Frequently Asked Questions]] (FAQ) memo published by ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/08/boundless-informant-nsa-full-text |title=Boundless Informant: NSA explainer – full document text &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Top Secret]] [[heat map]] display also published by ''The Guardian'' and allegedly produced by the Boundless Informant program, almost 3 billion data elements from inside the United States were captured by NSA over a 30-day period ending in March 2013.

Data analyzed by Boundless Informant includes [[Computer surveillance|electronic surveillance program]] records (DNI) and [[pen register|telephone call metadata]] records (DNR) stored in an NSA data archive called GM-PLACE. It does not include [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] data, according to the FAQ memo. [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], a government codename for a collection effort known officially as US-984XN, which was revealed at the same time as Boundless Informant, is one source of DNR data. According to the map, Boundless Informant summarizes data records from 504 separate DNR and DNI collection sources ([[SIGAD]]s). In the map, countries that are under surveillance are assigned a color from green, representing least coverage to red, most intensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/08/nsa-boundless-informant-data-mining-slides |title=Boundless Informant NSA data-mining tool – four key slides &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/06/07/11-questions-you-probably-have-about-u-s-domestic-spying-answered/ |title= Government: 11 things you need to know about u.s. domestic spying |publisher=The Blaze, Inc. |date=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Prism slide 2.jpg|thumb|Slide showing that much of the world's communications flow through the US.]]
Intelligence gathered by the United States government inside the United States or specifically targeting US citizens is legally required to be gathered in compliance with the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] of 1978 (FISA) and under the authority of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISA court).&lt;ref name="Dean1"&gt;Dean, John W. [http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/dean/20051230.html George W. Bush as the New Richard M. Nixon: Both Wiretapped Illegally, and Impeachable; Both Claimed That a President May Violate Congress' Laws to Protect National Security], FindLaw, December 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holtzman1"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060130/holtzman The Impeachment of George W. Bush] by [[Elizabeth Holtzman]], [[The Nation]], January 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABA1"&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/op/greco/memos/aba_house302-0206.pdf Adopted By The House Of Delegates], [[American Bar Association]], February 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

NSA global data mining projects have existed for decades, but recent programs of intelligence gathering and analysis that include data gathered from inside the United States such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] were enabled by changes to US surveillance law introduced under [[Presidency of George W. Bush|President Bush]] and renewed under President Obama in December 2012.&lt;ref name=Greenwald1&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|title=NSA taps in to internet giants' systems to mine user data, secret files reveal|work=The Guardian|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data|accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boundless Informant was first publicly revealed on June 8, 2013, after classified documents about the program were leaked to ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boundless-informant |title=Boundless Informant &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper identified its informant, at his request, as [[Edward Snowden]], who worked at the NSA for the [[defense contractor]] [[Booz Allen Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edward Snowden: the whistleblower behind revelations of NSA surveillance|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
According to published slides, Boundless Informant leverages [[Free and Open Source Software]]—and is therefore "available to all NSA developers"—and corporate services hosted in the [[Cloud Computing|cloud]]. The tool uses [[HDFS]], [[MapReduce]], and [[Apache Accumulo|Accumulo]] (formerly Cloudbase)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/07/nsa-accumulo-google-bigtable/ |title=NSA Mimics Google, Pisses Off Senate, Cade Metz |publisher=Wired |date= 2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for data processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/710559-doc01187820130608104742.html#document/p4 |title=Boundless Informant slides |publisher=Documentcloud.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality and FISA Amendments Act of 2008==
The [[FISA Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendments Act]] (FAA) Section 702 is referenced in [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] documents detailing the electronic interception, capture and analysis of [[metadata]]. Many reports and letters of concern written by members of Congress suggest that this section of FAA in particular is legally and constitutionally problematic, such as by targeting U.S. persons, insofar as "Collections occur in U.S." as published documents indicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Office |first=Communications |url=http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/blog/post/fisa-correspondence-update |title=FISA Correspondence Update &amp;#124; Blog &amp;#124; U.S. Senator Ron Wyden |publisher=Wyden.senate.gov |date=2012-12-10 |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/nsa-response-to-senators-oct-10-letter-about-fisa-reauthorization |title=Download &amp;#124; U.S. Senator Ron Wyden |publisher=Wyden.senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2012/06/IC-IG-Letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/natsec/faafoia20101129/FAAFBI0065.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU has asserted the following regarding the FAA: "Regardless of abuses, the problem with the FAA is more fundamental: the statute itself is unconstitutional."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclu.org/national-security/faa-foia-documents |title=FAA FOIA Documents &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Rand Paul]] is introducing new legislation called the Fourth Amendment Restoration Act of 2013 to stop the NSA or other agencies of the [[United States]] government from violating the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]] using technology and [[big data]] information systems like [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] and Boundless Informant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=838&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paul.senate.gov/files/documents/EAS13699.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
