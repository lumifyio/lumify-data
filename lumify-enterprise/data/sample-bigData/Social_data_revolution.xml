      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''social data revolution''' is the shift in human communication patterns towards increased personal information sharing and its related implications, made possible by the rise of [[social networks]] in early 2000s. This phenomenon has resulted in the accumulation of [[Big data|unprecedented]] amounts of public data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= | last= | coauthors= Andreas Weigend |authorlink= | title= The Social Data Revolution | date= | publisher= | url = http://blogs.hbr.org/now-new-next/2009/05/the-social-data-revolution.html | work =[[Harvard Business Review]] | pages = | accessdate = July 15, 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This large and frequently updated data source has been described as a new type of scientific instrument for the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Pulse"&gt;{{cite book|first=Douglas|last=Hubbard|title=Pulse: The New Science of Harnessing Internet Buzz to Track Threats and Opportunities|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several independent researchers have used social data to "nowcast" and forecast trends such as unemployment, flu outbreaks,&lt;ref name="nowcasting_flu"&gt;Vasileios Lampos and Nello Cristianini.

ACM TIST 3(4), n.72, 2012. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2337542.2337557&lt;/ref&gt; mood of whole populations,&lt;ref name="nowcasting_mood"&gt;Nowcasting the mood of the nation

Social data refers to data individuals create that is knowingly and voluntarily shared by them. Cost and overhead previously rendered this semi-public form of communication unfeasible, but advances in social networking technology from 2004-2010 has made broader concepts of sharing possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= | last= | coauthors = Swathi Dharshana Naidu |authorlink= | title= Social Data Revolution | date= Dec, 2009 | publisher= | url = http://swathidharshananaidu.posterous.com/social-data-revolution | work =[[Posterous]] | pages = | accessdate = 7/8/2010 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of data users are sharing include [[geolocation]], medical data,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= | last= | coauthors= Esther Dyson |authorlink= | title= Health, not Health Care! | date= March 23, 2010 | publisher= | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/esther-dyson/health-not-health-care_b_510830.html | work =[[Huffington Post]] | pages = | accessdate = 6/8/2010 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; dating preferences, open thoughts, interesting news articles, etc.

Early examples of social data are [[Craigslist]] and the wishlists of [[Amazon.com]]. Both enable users to communicate information to anybody who is looking for it. They differ in their approach to [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. Craigslist leverages the power of anonymity, while Amazon.com leverages the power of persistent identity, based on the history of the customer with the firm. The job market is even being shaped by the information people share about themselves on sites like [[LinkedIn]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= | last= | coauthors = Reid Hoffman |authorlink= | title= Future of Jobs &amp; Social Data Revolution | date= June 26, 2009 | publisher= | url = http://www.techaffair.com/2009/06/reid-hoffman-ceo-of-linkedin-on-the-future-of-jobs-social-data-revolution/ | work = Techaffair.com | pages = | accessdate = 7/2/2010 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of more mature social data are [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. On Twitter, sending a message or tweet is as simple as sending an SMS text message. Twitter made this C2W, customer to world: Any tweet a users sends can potentially be read by the entire world. Facebook focuses on interactions between friends, C2C in traditional language. It provides many ways for collecting data from its users: "[[Tag (metadata)|tag]]" a friend in a photo, "comment" on what they posted, or just "like" it. These data are the basis for sophisticated models of the relationships between users. They can be used to significantly increase the [[Recommendation engine|relevance]] of what is shown to the user, and for advertising purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= | last= | coauthors= Esther Dyson |authorlink= | title= The Coming Ad Revolution | date= February 11, 2008 | publisher= | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120269162692857749.html | work =[[The Wall Street Journal]] | pages = | accessdate = 4/10/2010 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social data revolution does not only enable new business models like the ones on [[Amazon.com]], but also provides large opportunities to improve [[decision-making]] for public policy and [[international development]].&lt;ref name="HilbertBigData2013"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2205145 "Big Data for Development: From Information- to Knowledge Societies"], Martin Hilbert (2013), SSRN Scholarly Paper No. ID 2205145). Rochester, NY: Social Science Research Network; http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2205145&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of large amounts of social data leads to the field of [[Computational sociology#Data mining and social network analysis|Computational Social Science]]. Classic examples include the study of [http://mediapatterns.enm.bris.ac.uk/ media content] or of [http://mediapatterns.enm.bris.ac.uk/twittermood social media content].&lt;ref name="nowcasting_flu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nowcasting_mood" /&gt;
