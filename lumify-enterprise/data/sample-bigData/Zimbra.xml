'''Zimbra Collaboration Suite''' ('''ZCS''') is a [[groupware]] [[email server]] and web client, currently owned and developed by [[VMware]] Inc.

Zimbra was initially developed by Zimbra Inc and first released in 2005. The company was subsequently purchased by [[Yahoo!]] in September 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zimbra.com |url=http://www.zimbra.com/about/yahoo_acquires_zimbra.html |title=Yahoo! Acquires Zimbra |publisher=Zimbra.com |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later sold to [[VMware]] on January 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vance |first=Ashlee |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/vmware-gently-nudges-microsoft-with-a-zimbra/ |title=VMware Gently Nudges Microsoft with a Zimbra |publisher=New York Times Bits Blog |date=2010-01-13 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to former Zimbra President and CTO Scott Dietzen, the name for Zimbra is derived from the song "[[I Zimbra]]" by [[Talking Heads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dietzen |first=Scott |url=http://blog.zimbra.com/blog/archives/2005/09/so-whats-a-zimbra.html |title=So what's a Zimbra? |publisher=Zimbra Blog |date=2005-09-12 |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Edition ==
The software consists of both [[client (computing)|client]] and [[server (computing)|server]] components.  Two versions of Zimbra are available: an [[open source|open-source]] version, and a commercially supported version ("Network Edition") with [[closed-source]] components such as a proprietary MAPI connector to Outlook for calendar and contact synchronisation.&lt;ref name="VMware Zimbra"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zimbra Compatiblity with Other Desktop Clients|url=http://www.zimbra.com/products/desktop-compatiblity.html|work=VMare Zimbra Official Web Site|publisher=VMware Zimbra|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbra Desktop is a full-featured free desktop [[email client]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zimbra Desktop|url=http://www.zimbra.com/products/desktop.html|work=VMare Zimbra Official Web Site|publisher=VMware Zimbra|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is still supported in version 7 but has reached End of Life in version 7.2.2 and will be replaced with an HTML5 offline mode in version 9.

The ZCS Web Client is a full-featured collaboration suite that supports email, group calendars and document sharing using an [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] web interface that enables tool tips, drag-and-drop items, and right-click menus in the UI.  Also included are advanced searching capabilities and date relations, online document authoring, "Zimlet" [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]s and a full administration UI. It is written using the ''Zimbra Ajax Toolkit.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zimbra Documentation for the Zimbra Web Client|url=http://www.zimbra.com/support/documentation/zwc-documentation.html|work=VMare Zimbra Official Web Site|publisher=VMware Zimbra|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ZCS Server uses several open source projects (see the section, ''[[#Included open source projects|Included open source projects]]''). It exposes a [[SOAP (protocol)|SOAP]] [[application programming interface]] to all its functionality and is also an [[IMAP]] and [[POP3]] server.  The server runs on many distributions of [[Linux]] as well as on [[Mac OS X]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zimbra Open Source|url=http://www.zimbra.com/products/zimbra-open-source.html|work=VMare Zimbra Official Web Site|publisher=VMware Zimbra|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZCS can synchronize mail, contacts, and calendar items with open-source mail clients such as [[Evolution (software)|Evolution]] and also with proprietary clients such as [[Microsoft Outlook]] and [[Apple Mail]], but only through proprietary connectors available exclusively in the commercially supported version. Zimbra also provides native two-way sync to many mobile devices ([[Nokia Eseries]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Windows Mobile]], [[iPhone]],  [[Android (operating system)|Android]]).&lt;ref name="VMware Zimbra"/&gt;
