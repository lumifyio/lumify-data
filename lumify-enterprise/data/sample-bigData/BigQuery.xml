'''BigQuery''' is a [[Restful|RESTful]] [[web service]] that enables interactive analysis of massively large datasets working in conjunction with [[Google Storage]]. It is an ''Infrastructure as a Service'' ([[Cloud computing#Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)|IaaS]]) that may be used complementary with [[MapReduce]].

== Design ==
BigQuery (BQ) is reportedly based on [[Dremel (software)|Dremel]],&lt;ref name="goog-dremel"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets}}&lt;/ref&gt; a scalable, interactive ad-hoc query system for analysis of read-only nested data. To use the data in BigQuery, it first must be uploaded to [[Google Storage]] and in a second step imported using the BigQuery HTTP API. BigQuery requires all requests to be authenticated, supporting a number of Google-proprietary mechanisms as well as [[OAuth]].

== Features ==
* '''Managing data''' - create and delete tables based on a JSON-encoded schema, import data from [[Google Storage]].
* ''' Query''' - the queries are expressed in a SQL dialect and the results are returned in [[JSON]] with a maximum reply length of approximately 64&amp;nbsp;MB.&lt;ref name="Google BigQuery API"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google BigQuery API Overview (V2)|url=https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/developers_guide#maxresponsesize|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some limitations to the usual SQL queries. For example, BigQuery supports joins, but one of the two JOINed tables must be small enough.
* '''Integration''' - BigQuery can be used from [[Google Apps Script]] and [[Google Docs|Google Spreadsheets]].
* '''Access Control''' - is done via [[Google Storage]].
