==Background==
RainStor is headquartered in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]] and also operates an office in [[Gloucester]], [[United Kingdom]] and more recently an office in [[New York]].&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt; Originally named Clearpace, RainStor was renamed when company headquarters and operations moved to the [[United States]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="TR"/&gt; Engineering specialists in the [[United Kingdom]] founded RainStor in 2002 to exploit technology developed by the [[UK]] [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], which was later, spun out and started commercially selling with its first GA product in 2008.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;

As of 2013, John Bantleman is [[Chief Executive Officer]] of RainStor and Jamie Andrews is the company's [[Chief Operating Officer]] (CFO).&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt; RainStor partners with companies including [[Amdocs]], [[Anritsu]], AdaptiveMobile, [[Dell]], Group2000, [[HP]], and [[Teradata]].&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt;

In March 2010, RainStor received $7.5 million in venture funding from Storm Ventures, Doughty Hanson Technology Ventures, [[Informatica]], and The Dow Company.&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt; In October 2012, RainStor received $12 million in venture funding from [[Credit Suisse]], Doughty Hanson Technolgy Ventures, Storm Ventures, The Dow Company, and Rogers Venture Partners.&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt;

As of October 2012, the company reportedly had over 100 commercial enterprise clients.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt; Bantleman publicly stated that RainStor wants to work with companies in the [[telecommunications]] and [[finance]] industries, as well as with government agencies.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt; Bantleman isolated these three industries because of their need for Big Data capabilities and more stringent compliance regulations around how they manage and retain data.

==Product==
RainStor has received positive press for keeping costs low while handling extremely high amounts of data.&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt; RainStor essentially provides two solutions with its database product, one for the purpose of conducting fast query and analysis against large volumes of machine generated data and the other for an online data archive for the purpose of compliant data retention.&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F"/&gt;

In October 2012, RainStor held two patents and was actively pursuing the approval of five additional patents.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt; RainStor executives claim that they can reduce the volume of Big Data by 95% or more by using innovative data compression and de-duplication technology.&lt;ref name="G"/&gt;

RainStorâ€™s database product can reportedly load ~1m records per second.&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; RainStor software uses partition filtering, which excludes certain records from processing.&lt;ref name="TR"/&gt;

RainStor operates on [[Apache]]'s [[Hadoop Distributed File System]].&lt;ref name="RH"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redherring.com/hardware/rainstor-nabs-12m-for-compressed-databases/ | title=RainStor Nabs $12M for Compressed Databases | publisher=''[[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]]'' | date=October 18, 2012 | accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and Achievements==
RainStor was named the 2011 AlwaysOn Global 250 Award Winner by AlwaysOn in 2011.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aonetwork.com/AOStory/Announcing-2011-AlwaysOn-Global-250 | title=Announcing the 2011 AlwaysOn Global 250 | publisher=''AlwaysOn Network'' | date=July 30, 2011 | accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Golden Bridge awarded the leader in Information Technology award for 2011 to RainStor.&lt;ref name="GBA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goldenbridgeawards.com/awards/2011/ | title=2011 Winners | publisher=''The Golden Bridge Awards'' | accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; RainStor was awarded the Cool Vendor award in the Storage Technologies category by Gartner.&lt;ref name="G2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/cool-vendors/2011.jsp | title=Gartner Cool Vendors 2011 | publisher=''[[Gartner]]'' | accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; RainStor was named a Top 100 private company in both 2010 and 2011 by AlwaysOn On Demand.&lt;ref name="AON"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aonetwork.com/AOStory/Announcing-2011-OnDemand-100-Top-Private-Companies | title=Announcing the 2011 OnDemand 100 Top Private Companies | publisher=''AlwaysOn Network'' | date=March 30, 2011 | accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also named by a Top 100 hot company by Network Computing Guide.
