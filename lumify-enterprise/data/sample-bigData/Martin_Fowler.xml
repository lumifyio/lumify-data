'''Martin Fowler''' (born 1963) is an Anglo-American [[software engineer]], author and international speaker on software development, specializing in [[object oriented programming|object-oriented]] analysis and design, [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[Design pattern (computer science)|patterns]], and [[agile software development]] methodologies, including [[extreme programming]].

== Biography ==
Fowler was born and grew up in [[Walsall, England]], where he went to [[Queen Mary's Grammar School]] for his secondary education. He graduated at [[University College London]] in 1986. In 1994 he moved to the [[United States]], where he lives near [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] in the suburb of [[Melrose, Massachusetts|Melrose]].&lt;ref name="mfbio"&gt;[http://martinfowler.com/aboutMe.html Martin Fowler] at martinfowler.com. Accessdate Nov 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fowler started working with software in the early 1980s. Out of college in 1986 he started working in software development for [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]] until 1991.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Highsmitht (2002) ''Agile Software Development Ecosystems: Problems, Practices, and Principles''. p.133&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 he became Chief Scientist at [[ThoughtWorks]], a systems integration and consulting company.&lt;ref name="mfbio"/&gt; 

Fowler has written six books on the topic of software development (see ''[[#Publications|Publications]]''). He is a member of the ''[[Agile Alliance]]'' and helped create the [[Manifesto for Agile Software Development]] in 2001, along with more than 15 co-authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agilemanifesto.org/ Manifesto for Agile Software Development].
