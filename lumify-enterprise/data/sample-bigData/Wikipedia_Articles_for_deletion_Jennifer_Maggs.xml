Sociologist of questionable notability.  Article apparently started as a joke ("Jennifer plays the clarinet") and was later changed and expanded by another user... a bit confused as to how legit this really could be.  My theory is that the original user could've been writing an article about themselves, someone else Googled the name and found another person by the very same name, and decided to change the article to fit the bill.  Throwing this to the community for a wider assessment. --[[User:Czj|Czj]] 02:09, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Doesn't meet [[WP:N]]. [[User:Janejellyroll|janejellyroll]] 02:08, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' No sources, no context, no notability. '''[[User:Ganfon|&lt;font color="Blue"&gt;Gan&lt;/font&gt;]][[User Talk:Ganfon|&lt;font color="Green"&gt;fon&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 03:14, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' unless additional sources supplied. Can be kept or reinstated if evidence of notability is provided. She's a real person and the article is legit for the little it says, see [http://www.hhdev.psu.edu/hdfs/faculty/maggs.html], so anything that happened in the past shouldn't affect our discussion. For all I know she may be notable, but there isn't currently any evidence she is. --[[User:Shirahadasha|Shirahadasha]] 04:57, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' Here's some additional information: a bibliography [http://isbndb.com/d/person/maggs_jennifer.html]. 483 ghits for "jennifer maggs", 279 for "jennifer l maggs". --[[User:Shirahadasha|Shirahadasha]] 05:03, 21 January 2007 (UTC).
*'''Delete''', looks nn to me.  Sorry.  [[User:Lankiveil|Lankiveil]] 05:16, 21 January 2007 (UTC).
*'''Delete''' or properly source and cite [[User:Alf photoman|Alf photoman]] 15:43, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Perhaps her bibliography should be listed first, having a chance to turn this to a half-decent stub. As it is the article has no seeming merits. [[User:Dimadick]]
