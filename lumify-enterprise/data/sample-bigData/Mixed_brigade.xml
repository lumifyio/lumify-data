A '''mixed brigade''' ({{lang-es|brigada mixta}}) was a tactical [[military unit|military formation]] of the [[Spanish Republican Army]] following the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|coup of July 1936]] and the onset of the [[Spanish Civil War]].
It was the basic military unit of the Republican People's Army after its war-dictated 1936 reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Orden, circular, creando un Comisariado general de Guerra con la misión que se indica.|publisher=Gaceta de Madrid: diario oficial de la República|date=16 October 1936|volume=Año CCLXXV Tomo IV, Núm. 290|page=355|url=http://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE/1936/290/B00355-00355.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial structure of this kind of [[brigade]], approved in October 1936, was composed of four infantry [[battalion]]s of five [[Company (military unit)|companies]] each, a mixed [[sapper]] battalion and a [[Military logistics|Service Corps]] company that included a [[medical corps]] group. Certain brigades had also a cavalry section.  A [[Division (military)|division]] was composed of two or three mixed brigades.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. (2001). ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. p.526&lt;/ref&gt;

The mixed brigade was based on a model that would replace the columns (''columnas'') and militias of the pre-coup Spanish Republican Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://petreraldia.com/reportajes/petrer-1936-las-quintas-de-la-guerra.html ''las Quintas de la Guerra'']&lt;/ref&gt; The first six [[Mixed Brigade]]s were created on 18 October 1936. The first was led by Communist colonel [[Enrique Líster]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. (2001). ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. p.529&lt;/ref&gt; the second by [[Jesús Martínez de Aragón]], the third by [[José María Galán]], the fourth by [[Eutiquiano Arellano]], the fifth by [[Fernando Sabio]] and the sixth by [[Miguel Gallo Martínez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militar.org.ua/militar/hm/historia-militar-espana-guerra-civil-brigada-ejercito-republicano.html Las Brigadas Mixtas en el Ejército Popular de la República Española]&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1936 there were fifteen brigades in full service (1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 11th and 12th International Brigades, 35th, 37th, 39th, 40th, 41st, 43rd, 44th, 50th and one unumbered).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. (2001). ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. p.526&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 1937 there were 40 active brigades, and another 15 there were training. This brigades were swiftly placed in divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. (2001). ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. p.530&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed brigades were typically [[Army]] units, however, the [[151 Brigada Mixta]], was a mixed brigade composed of [[Spanish Republican Navy]] Marines ''([[Infantería de Marina]])'' led by Commander Pedro Muñoz Caro. Photographer [[Robert Capa]] took pictures of the 151 Brigada Mixta in the [[Battle of the Segre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediastore.magnumphotos.com/CoreXDoc/MAG/Media/TR3/f/8/1/6/PAR115600.jpg Robert Capa picture of the 151 Brigada Mixta at the Battle of the Segre]&lt;/ref&gt;
