'''Chatous''' is a [[social discovery platform]] that matches users based on [[Natural Language Processing]] and [[Big Data]] analytics for optimal conversations.  The site uses a data-driven approach and algorithm to predict which users will be compatible for conversation, and learns about users as they engage in more conversations. Founded by a team of [[Stanford University]] students, Chatous grew out of a project in a graduate computer science class at Stanford.&lt;ref&gt;
