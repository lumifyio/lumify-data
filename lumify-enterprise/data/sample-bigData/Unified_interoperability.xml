      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Unified interoperability''' is the property of a [[system]] that allows for the integration of real-time and non-real time communications, activities, data, and information services (i.e., unified) and the display and coordination of those services across systems and devices (i.e., [[interoperability]]).&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Ben|title=Invalid Files and Language Learning: Your Brain's Interoperable World|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-thomas/invalid-files-and-languag_b_2784306.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YV&gt;{{cite web|last=Bandoim|first=Lana|title=Unified Interoperability as the Alternative to Big Data Costs?|publisher=Yahoo!

==Unified communications==

Unified communications has been led by the business world, which has a need for efficiency, simplicity, and speed. Rather than a single tool or product, unified communications is a set of products that deliver a nearly identically [[user experience]] across multiple devices or media types.&lt;ref name=ARI /&gt;&lt;ref name=WUC&gt;{{cite web|title=Unified Communications|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Communications|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MIC&gt;{{cite web|title=Interoperability|url=http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/en/us/interoperability/default.aspx|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system begins with “[[presence information]]” - a feature of [[telecommunications]] technology that “senses” where a user is in relation to the technology.&lt;ref name=WUC /&gt;&lt;ref name=MIC /&gt; This change has been dominated by telecommunications providers integrating [[video]], [[instant messaging]], voice, and collaboration.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=YV /&gt;&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt;

==Unified Communications Interoperability Forum==

In May 2010, a number of communications technology vendors founded a [[nonprofit organization]] for the advancement of interoperability.&lt;ref name=WUCIF&gt;{{cite web|title=Unified Communications Interoperability Forum|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Communications_Interoperability_Forum|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCIF&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Website|url=http://www.ucif.org|work=UCI Forum|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the [[Unified Communications Interoperability Forum]] is to enable complete interoperability of hardware and [[software]] across huge networks of systems.&lt;ref name=UCIF /&gt; The [http://www.ucif.org/ UCIF] relies on existing standards rather than the authoring of new ones.&lt;ref name=WUCIF /&gt;&lt;ref name=UCIF /&gt;

==Interoperability==

In the broadest sense, interoperability is the ability of multiple systems (usually [[computer systems]]) to work together seamlessly.&lt;ref name=CG&gt;{{cite web|last=Luth|first=Jim|title=Unified architecture – The future of OPC|url=http://www.controlglobal.com/articles/2004/229.html|work=Control|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ONW&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime|url=http://www.onwindows.com/Portals/0/images/prime-issue-14.pdf|publisher=ON Windows|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PNE&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Website|url=http://pneuron.com/technology/differenciated-design-pattern.html|work=Pneuron|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WI&gt;{{cite web|title=Interoperability|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Information Age]], interoperability is a highly desirable trait for most business systems.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=ONW /&gt; Likewise, as homes become more infused with networked technologies ([[desktop PCs]], [[tablet computers]], [[smartphones]], Internet-ready television), interoperability becomes an issue even for the average consumer.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=ONW /&gt;

Computer [[operating system]]s are a prime example of interoperability, wherein several programs from different vendors are able to co-exist and, in many cases, exchange data in a meaningful way.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNE /&gt; An operating system is also “unified” in the sense that it presents the user with a common, easy to understand computer [[interface]] for executing numerous tasks.&lt;ref name=YV /&gt;&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNE /&gt; The unified interoperability of computers means that users need not have specialized knowledge about how computers function.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt;

A system with the property of interoperability will retain that property well into the future.&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt; The system will be adaptable to the rapid changes in technology with only minor adjustments.&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt;

==Syntactic interoperability==

The most fundamental level of interoperability is [[syntactic]] interoperability. At this level, systems can exchange data without loss or corruption.&lt;ref name=DL&gt;{{cite web|last=Jovellanos|first=Chito|title=Semantic and syntactic interoperability: in transactional systems|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=779991|publisher=ACM Digital Library|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[data formats]] are especially suited to the exchange of data between diverse systems. [[XML]] (extensible markup language), for instance, allows data to be transmitted in a comprehensible format for people and machines.&lt;ref name=DL /&gt; [[SQL]] (structured query language), on the other hand, is an industry-standard, nearly universal format for compiling information in a [[database]].&lt;ref name=DL /&gt; SQL databases are essential for a business such as [[Amazon.com]], with its vast catalog of products, attributes, and consumer reviews.&lt;ref name=DL /&gt;&lt;ref name=DPE&gt;{{cite web|last=Paskin|first=Norman|title=Identifier interoperability|url=http://www.digitalpreservationeurope.eu/publications/briefs/identifier-interoperability.pdf|publisher=Digital Preservation Europe|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic interoperability==

[[Semantic interoperability]] goes a step further than syntactic interoperability.&lt;ref name=DPE /&gt; Systems with semantic interoperability can not only exchange date effortlessly, but also interpret and communicate that data to human users in a meaningful, actionable way.&lt;ref name=DPE /&gt;&lt;ref name=QU&gt;{{cite web|title=Semantic Interoperability|url=http://www.qualipso.org/node/35|work=Qualipso|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributed functions and processing interoperability==

Distributed functions and processing interoperability focus on the ability to create new products, applications and [[operating model]]s without traditional intermediaries like [[data model]]s, databases or large system integrations through establishing a Unified Interoperability [[Software_framework|framework]] between normally, diverse and distributed sources, data, technology and other assets.&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=WIS /&gt;&lt;ref name=OPC&gt;{{cite web|title=OPC Unified Architecture|url=http://www.opcfoundation.org/Default.aspx/01_about/UA.asp?MID=AboutOPC|publisher=OPC|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneered by companies like Pneuron, it enables business problems to be solved by connecting interoperable components of any characteristic into single, uniform, global “instruction chain” of functionality.&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNE /&gt; Components use existing [[IP address|IP]] or applications and so integrate disparate technology to a uniform platform.&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt; Configuration models combine runtime processing infrastructure for common and predictable [[Performance improvement|performance]], security, resiliency, and availability with the whole process, enabling the uniform exchange of data and consistent processing across components, irrespective of technology, format or location.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNE /&gt;

==Benefits of unified interoperability==

Unified interoperability offers benefits for every [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] in a system. For customers and [[end-users]] of a system, unified interoperability offers a more convenient, satisfying experience.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt; In business, interoperability helps lower costs and improves overall efficiency.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNE /&gt; As businesses strive to maximize the efficiency of their integrated systems, they encourage [[innovation]] and [[problem solving]].&lt;ref name=DJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=PNE /&gt;
