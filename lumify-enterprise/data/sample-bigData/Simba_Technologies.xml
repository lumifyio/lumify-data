'''Simba Technologies Inc.''' is a [[software]] company based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Simba specializes in products for [[ODBC]], [[JDBC]], [[OLE DB]] for [[OLAP]] (ODBO) and [[XML for Analysis]] (XMLA). The company licenses data connectivity technologies, and provides software development for  [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[UNIX]], [[Macintosh|Mac]] and mobile device platforms{{which|date=April 2013}}. Simba Technologies was founded in Vancouver and [[Seattle, Washington]] in 1991. Customers include [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[MIS AG]], [[SAP AG]] and Descisys.

==Products==
Simba's products include a [[JDBC]]/[[ODBC]] [[Software development kit|SDK]], an [[OLAP]]/ODBO/XMLA SDK, a [[SQL]] to [[Multidimensional Expressions|MDX]] adaptor, an ODBO to XMLA bridge, and MDX Provider for [[Oracle OLAP]], and other data connectivity products.

==History==
Simba co-developed the first standards based [[ODBC]] driver with Microsoft in 1992, Simba.DLL. The first ODBC driver was included in Microsoft [[Windows 3.1]], and has since been installed on over 30 million computers{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. ODBC is a widely-used data access inteface for [[relational database]] management systems [[RDBMS]]. [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] and Oracle licensed Simba products in 1993{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. In 1994, [[Attachmate]], Liant and Simba jointly developed a product that would allow Attachmate to use Simba's [[Software development kit|SDK]] products to build their original [[QuickDB]] server{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}.   

In 1993, the company was the first to introduce an ODBC Software Development Kit SDK to build custom ODBC drivers allowing users to use standard-compliant Business Intelligence [[Business intelligence|BI]] applications and platforms, such as [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Tableau Software|Tableau]], Alteryx and [[SAP AG|SAP]] BusinessObjectives for analysis and reporting.

In 2012 Simba Technologies developed an ODBC driver for [[Hadoop]]/[[Apache Hive|Hive]] [[Big Data]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://finance.yahoo.com/news/simba-mapr-technologies-partner-deliver-120000985.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ODBC 3.52 driver enables users to directly access and analyse Big Data sources, using the [[Business intelligence|BI]] tool of their choice.&lt;ref name="marketwatch"&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/simba-technologies-odbc-352-driver-technology-chosen-by-alteryx-to-access-cloud-data-in-hadoop-2012-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;
