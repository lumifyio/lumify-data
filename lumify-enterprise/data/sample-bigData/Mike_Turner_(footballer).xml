'''Michael George Elliott Turner''' (born 20 September 1938 in [[Bridport]], [[Dorset]]) is an [[England|English]] former professional [[Association football|football]] goalkeeper.

==Football career==

He was capped by [[England national football team|England]] at youth level, but due to service in the [[RAF]] had to wait until December 1961 to turn professional when he joined [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] from non-league [[Dorchester Town F.C.|Dorchester Town]]. He played 75 league games for Swindon and was part of Swindon's first ever promotion winning team in the 1962-63 season, before joining [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in July 1964. He played 14 league games for Torquay over the next 2 seasons, before leaving the professional game.

He subsequently returned to [[Dorset]], working for [[Plessey]]s for 20 years before retiring (in October 2006 he was living in [[Poole]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wiltshire/content/articles/2006/10/05/stfc_b_051006_feature.shtml STFC's first-ever promotion]&lt;/ref&gt;
