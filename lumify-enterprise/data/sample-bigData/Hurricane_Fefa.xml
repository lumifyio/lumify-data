'''Hurricane Fefa''' was a major [[Pacific hurricane]] of the [[1991 Pacific hurricane season]] that despite causing minimal effects its name was removed from the [[lists of tropical cyclone names|list of tropical cyclone names]]. The sixth tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, the storm developed from a [[tropical wave]] on July 29 about 975&amp;nbsp;miles (1,575&amp;nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Cabo San Lucas]]. It moved west-northwestward, and under generally favorable conditions it strengthened to attain peak winds of 120&amp;nbsp;mph (195&amp;nbsp;km/h) on August 2. Fefa turned to the west towards [[Hawaii]], and slowly weakened until dissipating near the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]].

The hurricane produced rough surf, moderate wind gusts, and locally heavy rainfall during its passage over Hawaii. No damages or deaths were reported. Two people were injured in the island of Hawaii due to lightning strikes from the storm.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Fefa 1991 track.png}}
A westward-moving [[tropical wave]] exited the coast of [[Africa]] on July 17. It tracked across the unfavorable [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] without development, and after crossing [[Central America]], it entered the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] on July 25. The cloud pattern and convection began to become better organized on July 28, and shortly thereafter a mid-level circulation developed. It continued to organize, and subsequent to the development of a low-level circulation it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975&amp;nbsp;miles (1,575&amp;nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Cabo San Lucas]] on July 29.&lt;ref name="tcr1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield|year=1991|title=Hurricane Fefa Tropical Cyclone Report Page 1|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/prenhc/prelim01.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operationally, tropical cyclone advisories were not initiated until visible satellite images confirmed the low-level circulation twelve hours after the depression formed.&lt;ref name="disc1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield|year=1991|title=Tropical Depression Seven-E Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/tropdisc/nep0791.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located over warm waters with fair upper level outflow,&lt;ref name="disc1"/&gt; the depression quickly intensified and attained tropical storm status twelve hours after forming.&lt;ref name="tcr1"/&gt; Upon strengthening into a tropical storm, Fefa developed a curved cloud [[rainband|band]] over the southern and eastern portion of the center.&lt;ref name="disc1"/&gt; The storm slowly strengthened as it tracked west-northwestward, a motion due to the presence of a [[anticyclone|high-pressure]] [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its north.&lt;ref name="pasch3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pasch|year=1991|title=Tropical Storm Fefa Discussion Three|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/tropdisc/nep0791.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fefa initially strengthened slowly; on the day after it became a tropical storm the center was located on the western edge of the deep convection.&lt;ref name="mayfield6"&gt;{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield|year=1991|title=Tropical Storm Fefa Discussion Six|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/tropdisc/nep0791.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, convection began increasing over the center,&lt;ref name="rappaport7"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rappaport|year=1991|title=Tropical Storm Fefa Discussion Seven|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/tropdisc/nep0791.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is estimated it intensified into a hurricane later that day while located about 710&amp;nbsp;miles (1,145&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of the southern tip of [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]].&lt;ref name="tcr1"/&gt;

Initially, Fefa was forecast to intensify slightly after reaching hurricane status to reach peak winds of 80&amp;nbsp;mph (130&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name="gerrish8"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gerrish|year=1991|title=Hurricane Fefa Discussion Eight|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/tropdisc/nep0791.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it quickly intensified after a large, ragged [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] developed early on August 1.&lt;ref name="avila13"&gt;{{cite web|author=Avila|year=1991|title=Hurricane Fefa Discussion Thirteen|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/tropdisc/nep0791.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, the eye organized further, and Fefa strengthened to attain a peak intensity of 120&amp;nbsp;mph (195&amp;nbsp;km/h) while located about 940&amp;nbsp;miles (1,510&amp;nbsp;km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.&lt;ref name="tcr1"/&gt; Based on higher [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak numbers]], the hurricane could have peaked with winds stronger than 120&amp;nbsp;mph (195&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name="tcr2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield|year=1991|title=Hurricane Fefa Tropical Cyclone Report Page 2|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/prenhc/prelim01.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fefa encountered cooler waters shortly after peaking in intensity, and subsequently began to weaken.&lt;ref name="avila17"&gt;{{cite web|author=Avila|year=1991|title=Hurricane Fefa Discussion Seventeen|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/tropdisc/nep0791.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hurricane gradually weakened as it turned more to the west, a change in motion due to building high pressures to its north, and on August 3 the winds of Fefa dropped to 85&amp;nbsp;mph (135&amp;nbsp;km/h)&lt;ref name="tcr2"/&gt; due to cooler water and dry air.&lt;ref name="avila21"&gt;{{cite web|author=Avila|year=1991|title=Hurricane Avila Discussion 21|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/tropdisc/nep0791.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TS Fefa 07 aug 1991 1656Z.jpg|right|thumb|Tropical Storm Fefa to the east of Hawaii]]
As Fefa turned more to the west, it paralleled the cooler waters, allowing the eye to remain distinct as the hurricane remained well-organized.&lt;ref name="avila22"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Avila|year=1991|title=Hurricane Avila Discussion Twenty-Two|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/tropdisc/nep0791.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite moving over marginally warm [[sea surface temperature]]s and becoming involved with the [[Stratocumulus cloud]] field to its north, the hurricane restrengthened on August 4&lt;ref name="pasch23"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pasch|year=1991|title=Hurricane Fefa Discussion Twenty-Three|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1991/fefa/tropdisc/nep0791.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reach a secondary peak intensity of 105&amp;nbsp;mph (170&amp;nbsp;km/h) while located about 1,265&amp;nbsp;miles (2,070&amp;nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Hilo, Hawai'i]]. After maintaining 105&amp;nbsp;mph (170&amp;nbsp;km/h) winds for about 18&amp;nbsp;hours, Fefa weakened slightly due to increasing [[wind shear]] from a cold-core [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] as it entered the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] area of responsibility. As the shear increased, the cyclone weakened more rapidly, and on August 6 it weakened to a tropical storm while located about 650&amp;nbsp;miles (1,060&amp;nbsp;km) east of the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="tcr2"/&gt; Initially, forecasters predicted Fefa to turn to the northwest to the north of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. However, the storm continued moving almost due westward as it steadily weakened. [[Hurricane Hunters|Aircraft reconnaissance]] flew into Fefa three times as it neared [[Hawaii]]. Late on August 7, Fefa weakened to a tropical depression a short distance of the island of Hawaii, and early on August 8 the depression began dissipating and degenerated into a [[tropical wave]] after moving onshore. The remnants tracked west-northwestward and passed south of the Hawaiian Islands until dissipating on August 9 to the northwest of [[Kauai]].&lt;ref name="cphc"&gt;{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=1991|title=The 1991 Central Pacific Tropical Cyclone Season|accessdate=2006-12-09|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1991.php#Fefa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
[[Image:Hurricane Fefa 11 aug 1991 STS043 .jpg|thumb|Image of Fefa as a hurricane.]]
The prolonged westward track of Hurricane Fefa produced swells of up to 15&amp;nbsp;feet (4.5&amp;nbsp;m) in height. The swells hit eastward facing beaches along the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]]. The swells washed debris and sea water onto coastal roads near [[Punaluu Black Sand Beach]], resulting in the roads being closed following the storm.&lt;ref name="cphc"/&gt; Southwestern [[Maui]] experienced rough surf, as well.&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles H. Fletcher III, Eric E. Grossman, Bruce M. Richmond, and Ann E. Gibbs|year=2002|title=Atlas of Natural Hazards in the Hawaiian Coastal Zone|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2006-12-10|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/i2761/sections/1_Intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a weak tropical depression and a tropical wave while moving through the [[Hawaiian Islands]], Fefa produced locally strong wind gusts of up to 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80&amp;nbsp;km/h) in the islands of Hawaii and [[Maui]].&lt;ref name="cphc"/&gt;

Prior to moving across the island of Hawaii, strong thunderstorms developed in the northeastern portion of the remnant circulation of Fefa. The thunderstorms developed further as they moved over the slopes of [[Mauna Kea]] and [[Kohala (mountain)|Kohala]]. The thunderstorms produced heavy rainfall in areas, resulting in [[flash flood]]ing in [[Kohala, Hawaii|Kohala]] and [[Hamakua]]. Hurricane Fefa resulted in no known deaths. [[Lightning]] from the storm caused two injuries. A man in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]] was hurt when lightning struck where he was walking. A man in [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]] was burnt when lightning moved through telephone wires.&lt;ref name="cphc"/&gt; The storm resulted in no reported damage.&lt;ref name="jsc"&gt;{{cite web|author=Maura White|year=2006|title=Oblique View of Hurricane Fefa, Pacific Ocean|publisher=JSC Digital Image Collection|accessdate=2006-12-10|url=http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption_direct.jsp?photoId=STS043-74-005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Fefa was removed after this storm and replaced with Felicia in the [[1997 Pacific hurricane season|1997 season]]. It is unknown whether it was retired due to its damage or for another reason. Other possible reasons listed for the removal of a name are pronunciation ambiguity, a socially unacceptable meaning in another language, or because the storm name represented a significant human disaster.&lt;ref name="wmo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TCP30_Edition2012.pdf#page=101 |title=Regional Association IV (North America, Central America and the Caribbean) Hurricane Operational Plan |date=2012-06-11 |work=[https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/ Tropical Cyclone Programme] |publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]] |location=Geneva, Switzerland |volume=2012 Edition |at=p. 9-6 TABLE IV: Names of Eastern North Pacific Ocean Storms Retired into Hurricane History |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6E8uCgwju |archivedate=2013-02-02 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
