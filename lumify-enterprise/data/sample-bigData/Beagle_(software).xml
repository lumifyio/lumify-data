[[Image:Best.png|thumb|Old user interface for Beagle, code named Best]]
'''Beagle''' is a [[desktop search|search system]] for [[Linux]] and other such modern [[Unix-like]] systems, enabling the user to search documents, chat logs, email and contact lists in a similar way to [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]] in [[Mac OS X]], and [[Windows Search]] or [[Google Desktop]] (third party) under [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is [http://mail.gnome.org/archives/dashboard-hackers/2010-January/msg00001.html not actively developed].

Beagle grew out of [http://nat.org/dashboard/ Dashboard], an early [[Mono (software)|Mono]]-based application for watching and presenting useful information from a user's computer. It is written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] using Mono and uses a port of [[Lucene]] to C# called [[Lucene.net]] as its [[Search engine indexing|indexer]]. Beagle includes a [[Gtk Sharp|Gtk#]]-based user interface, and integrates with [[Galago (software)|Galago]] for [[presence information]].

Beagle was developed and maintained by [[Joe Shaw (programmer)|Joe Shaw]], with help from the [[open source]] community. Other notable past contributors include [[Jon Trowbridge]], [[Robert Love]], [[Nat Friedman]], and [[David Camp (programmer)|David Camp]].

== Features ==
Beagle searches the content of documents and associated metadata. With Beagle, users can search for:
* Applications
* Archives ([[ZIP (file format)|zip]], [[tar (file format)|tar]], [[gzip]], [[bzip2]]) and their contents
* Conversations ([[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]], [[Kopete]] and [[IRC]] logs)
* Documents ([[AbiWord]], [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Microsoft Office]], [[Portable Document Format|pdf]], [[.txt|txt]], [[Rich Text Format|rtf]], [[html]])
* [[Email]]s and Address Book contacts (from [[Novell Evolution|Evolution]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] (header info only), and [[KMail]])
* Help files ([[Texinfo]], [[man pages]])
* Images ([[Portable Network Graphics|png]], [[JPEG|jpg]], [[TIFF|tiff]], [[GIF|gif]], [[SVG|svg]])
* Music files ([[MP3|mp3]], [[ogg]], [[FLAC|flac]])
* Notes taken in [[Tomboy (software)|Tomboy]], [[KNotes]], and Labyrinth
* [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds (via [[Blam (software)|Blam]] or [[Akregator]])
* [[Source code]] ([[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Fortran]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and more)
* Video files (through [[MPlayer]] or [[Totem (media player)|Totem]])
* Web history ([[Firefox]], [[Konqueror]], [[Epiphany (web browser)|Epiphany]])

Beagle can also index additional file types not natively supported using external tools through a configuration file.

Beagle can efficiently index documents on Linux systems using [[inotify]].
