A '''general election''' was held in [[San Marino]] on 19 June 1909 to elect the '''second term''' of the [[Grand and General Council]].&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1678 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first election held in the country under [[universal suffrage]].

==Electoral law==
According to the decisions of the [[Sammarinese Citizenry Meeting, 1906|Meeting of 1906]], a third of the seats in the [[Grand and General Council]] should be renewed every three years; to do so, councillors elected in 1906 had been divided into three classes, under the model of the [[Senate of the United States]], by random [[sortition]]. The age limit to be an elector was lowered from 25 to 21 on 5 July 1906, but a major change occurred on 6 May 1909, when the Council passed a law establishing male [[universal suffrage]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consigliograndeegenerale.sm/on-line/home/archivio-leggi-decreti-e-regolamenti.html?P0_path=%2Fhome%2Ftomcat%2Findicizzazione%2Findexleggi&amp;P0_paginazione=15&amp;P0_pagina=1&amp;P0_orderBy=index_lucene%2Cdata_ordered%2Cnumero&amp;P0_order=asc%2Cdesc%2Cdesc&amp;P0_operatorMustBe=yes&amp;P0_title=&amp;P0_tipo=&amp;P0_numero=&amp;P0_anno=1909&amp;annoiniziale=&amp;annofinale=&amp;P0_data_gg=&amp;P0_data_mm=&amp;P0_data_aa=&amp;P0_document=&amp;P0_data_ordered=&amp;indicericerca=-1&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 Grand and General Council database. (it.) ]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ancient constituency of [[City of San Marino]] was divided in two, ceding 10 seats to new constituency of [[Borgo Maggiore]].

All councillors were elected in their constituency using a [[plurality-at-large voting]], a [[non-partisan]] system. However, as happened in 1906, candidates elected generally belonged to the [[Liberalism|liberal]] group which had supported the democratic action of the [[Sammarinese Citizenry Meeting, 1906|Citizenry Meeting]] or, more, were members of the sole organized party of the country, the [[Sammarinese Socialist Party]]. If the political composition of the council did not change significantly, this time the Socialists refused to join the government they left in 1907 after disagreements around [[industry|industrial]] and [[religion|religious]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psd.sm/area/altri/enti/democratici/doc/doc100/nuovo_titano%20B%20.pdf Party of Socialists and Democrats of San Marino (it.) ]&lt;/ref&gt;
